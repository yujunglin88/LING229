RAFIKI:
From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinking, step into the sun
There's more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done
There is far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rolling high
Through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round

It's the circle of life
And it moves us all
Through despair and hope
Through faith and love
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the circle
The circle of life

HemZAZU:
It's an honor and a privilege, a duty I perform
With due sense of decorum and with pride
With deference and great respect very much the norm
Plus a hint of sycophancy on the side
To lay before my ruler all the facts about his realm
To fill him in on all the beastly news

MUFASA (spoken):
Yes, yes, Zazu, get on with it!

ZAZU:
In order that His Majesty stands sturdy at the helm
Aware of all the fauna's latest views

MUFASA (spoken):
Zazu! The morning report!

ZAZU (spoken):
Er - yes, Sire: the morning report!

(sung)
Chimps are going ape
Giraffes remain above it all
Elephants remember
Though just what I can't recall
Crocodiles are snapping up
Fresh offers from the banks
Showed interest in my nest egg
But I quickly said, "No thanks!"
We haven't paid the hornbills
And the vultures have a hunch
Not everyone invited will be
Coming back from lunch

This is the morning report
Gives you the long and the short
Every grunt, roar, and snort
Not a tale I distort
On the morning report

MUFASA (spoken):
What are you doing, son?

YOUNG SIMBA (spoken):
Pouncing...

MUFASA (spoken):
Ah. Let an old pro show you how it's done

ZAZU:
The buffalo have got a beef

MUFASA:
Stay low
To the ground

ZAZU:
About this season's grass
Warthogs have been thwarted
In attempts to save their gas

SIMBA:
Yes, stay low

ZAZU:
Flamingoes in the pink

MUFASA:
Shh, not a sound

ZAZU:
Chasing secretary birds
Saffron is this season's color
Seen in all the herds

MUFASA:
Take it slow
One more step

ZAZU:
Moving down the rank and file
To near the bottom rung
Far too many beetles are
Quite frankly in the dung

MUFASA:
Then
POUNCE!

ZAZU:
AAAAHH!

YOUNG SIMBA:
This is the morning report
Gives you the long and the short
Every grunt, roar and snort
Not a tale I distort

With quite so little hair

I'm brushing up on looking down

YOUNG NALA:

From little hornbills for a start

ZAZU:
If this is where the monarchy is headed
Count me out
Out of service, out of Africa
I wouldn't hang about
This child is getting wildly out of wing

Let every creature go for broke and sing
Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing
It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling

Two courses handed to us on a plate
We'll have you raw, won't be long to wait

Eat up!

I never thought hyenas essential
They're crude and unspeakably plain
But maybe they've a glimmer of potential
If allied to my vision and brain

SCAR:
I know that your powers of retention
Are as wet as a warthog's backside
But thick as you are, pay attention
My words are a matter of pride

It's clear from your vacant expressions
The lights are not all on upstairs
But we're talking kings and successions
Even you can't be caught unawares

So prepare for a chance of a lifetime
Be prepared for sensational news
A shining new era
Is tiptoeing nearer

SHENZI:
And where do we feature?

SCAR:
Just listen to teacher!
I know it sounds sordid
But you'll be rewarded
When at last I am given my dues
And injustice deliciously squared
Be prepared!

BANZAI (spoken):
Yeah! Be prepared. We'll be prepared. For what?

SCAR (spoken):
For the death of the king!

BANZAI (spoken):
Is he sick?

SCAR (spoken):
No, fool! We're going to kill him... and Simba too!

SHENZI (spoken):
Great idea! Who needs a king?

No king! No king! La la la la la la!

I will be king! Stick with me, and you'll never go hungry again!

Yay, all right! Long live the king! Long live the king!

HYENAS:
It's great that we'll soon be connected
With a king who'll be all-time adored

SCAR:
Of course, quid pro quo, you're expected
To take certain duties on board
The future is littered with prizes
And though I'm the main addressee
The point that I must emphasize is
You won't get a sniff without me!

HYENAS, SCAR:
So prepare for the coup of the century

SCAR:
Be prepared for the murkiest scam
Meticulous planning
Tenacity spanning
Decades of denial
Is simply why I'll

HYENAS:
Ooo!
We'll have food!
Lots of food
We repeat
Endless meat

SCAR:
Be king undisputed
Respected, saluted
And seen for the wonder I am

I had that once. It was worms

No, no, no... it's like an itch... deep, persistent, profound

That's it - worms! When they get really bad all you gotta do is hunker down and scoot -

If it weren't for me you'd be beating off buzzards for your next bite!

HYENAS:
Yeah, you're our savior, thanks a bunch
But how about some lunch?

I need a fix of flesh
My bones have moved to where they've never been
They are on the outside looking in

What?

TIMON:
And they don't have a clue

PUMBAA:
Who?

TIMON:
They'll fall in love
And here's the bottom line
Our trio's down to two

PUMBAA:
Oh

TIMON:
The sweet caress of twilight
There's magic everywhere
And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disaster's in the air!

ENSEMBLE:
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world for once in perfect harmony
With all its living things

SIMBA:
So many things to tell her
But how to make her see
The truth about my past, impossible
She'd turn away from me

NALA:
He's holding back, he's hiding
But what, I can't decide
Why won't he be the king I know he is?
The king I see inside?

NALA, SIMBA:
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world for once in perfect harmony
With all its living things

Can you feel the love tonight?
You needn't look too far
Stealing through the night's uncertainties
Love is where we are

NALA:
And if he feels the love tonight
In the way I do

SIMBA:
It's enough for this restless wanderer

SIMBA, NALA:
Just to be with youENSEMBLE:
