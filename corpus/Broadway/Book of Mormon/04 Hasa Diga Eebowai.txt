MAFALA:
In this part of Africa, we ALL have a saying- whenver something bad happens, we just throw our hands up to the sky and say HASA DIGA EEBOWAI!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Hasa Diga Eebowai?

MAFALA:
Its the only way to get through all these troubled times.
Theres war, poverty, famine... but having a saying makes it all seem better!

There isnt enough food to eat!
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
People are starving in the street!

UGANDANS and MAFALA:
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

ELDER PRICE:
Well, thats pretty neat!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
DOes it mean no worries for the rest of our days?

MAFALA:
Kind of!

Weve had no rain in several days!

UGANDANS:
Hasa DIga Eebowai!

MAFALA:
And 80% of us have AIDS!

UGANDANS:
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

MAFALA:
Many young girls here get
Circumcised,
Their clits get cut right off.

ALL:
Way oh!

WOMEN:
And so we say up to the sky-

UGANDANS:
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

MAFALA:
Now you try! Just stand up tall, tilt your head to the sky,
and list off all the bad things in your life!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Somebody took our luggage away!

UGANDANS:
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

ELDER PRICE:
The plane was crowded,
And the bus was late!

UGANDANS:
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

MAFALA:
When the world is getting you down,
Theres nobody else to blame!

UGANDANS:
Way oh!

MAFALA:
Raise your middle finger to the sky,
And curse his rotten name!

ELDER PRICE:
Wait, what?!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

UGANDANS:
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Am I saying it right?

ELDER PRICE:
Excuse me sir, but what EXACTLY does that phrase mean?

MAFALA:
Well, lets see... "Eebowai" means "God".
And "Hasa Diga" means... "Fuck You".
So I guess in English it would be "Fuck you, God!"

UGANDANS:
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

ELDER PRICE:
WHAT?!

MAFALA:
When God fucks you in the butt-

UGANDANS:
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

MAFALA:
Fuck him right back in his cunt!

UGANDANS:
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
Fuck you, God!

ELDER PRICE:
Excuse me, Sir, but you should really NOT be saying that.
Things arent always as bad as they seem!

MAFALA:
Oh really? Well take this fucking asshole, Mutumbo.
He got caught last week trying to RAPE a baby.

ELDER PRICE:
What?! Why?!

MAFALA:
Some people in his tribe believe having sex with a virgin will cure their AIDS.
There arent many virgins left, so some of them are turning to babies.

ELDER PRICE:
But... thats horrible!

MAFALA:
I know!

UGANDANS:
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

MAFALA:
Heres the butcher, he has AIDS.
Heres the teacher, she has AIDS.
Heres the doctor, he has AIDS.
Heres my daughter, she has A....
Wonderful disposition.
Shes all I have left in the world.
And if either of you lays a hand on her...
I will give you my AIDS!

UGANDANS:
If you dont like what we say,
Try living here a couple days!
Watch all your friends and family die!
Hasa Diga Eebowai!
(Fuck you!)
Hasa Diga Eebowai!

Fuck you God in the ass, mouth,
And cunt-a
Fuck you God in the ass, mouth,
And cunt-a
Fuck you God in the ass, mouth
