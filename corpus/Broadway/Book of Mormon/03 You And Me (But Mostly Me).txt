Ive always had the hope
That on the day I go to heaven,
Heavenly Father will shake my hand and say:
"Youve done an AWESOME job, Kevin!"
Now its our time to go out...

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:

ELDER PRICE:
And set that worlds people free!
And we can do it together,
You and me-
But mostly me!
You and me-but mostly me
Are gonna change the world forever.
Cause I can do most anything!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
And I can stand next to you and WATCH!

ELDER PRICE:
Every hero needs a sidekick!
Every captain needs a mate!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
