ELDER PRICE
Ever since I was a child
I tried to be the best...
So what happened?
My family and friends all said I was blessed...
so what happened?

It was supposed to be all so exciting.
To be teaching of Christ across the sea.
But I allowed my faith to be shaken-
Oh, what's the matter with me?

I've always longed to help the needy.
To do the things I never dared.
This was the time for me to step up.
So then why was I so scared?

A warlord that shoots people in the face.
What's so scary about that?
I must trust that my Lord is mightier,
And always has my back.
Now I must completely devout
I can't have even one shred of doubt!

I believe-
That the Lord God created the universe.
I believe-
That he sent his only son to die for my sins.
And I believe-
That ancient Jews built boats and sailed
to America.
I am a Mormon.
And a Mormon just believes.

You cannot just believe part-way.
You have to believe in it all.
My problem was doubting
the Lord's will.
Instead of standing tall.
I can't allow myself to have any doubt.

It's time to set my worries free.
Time to show the world
What Elder Price is about.
And share the power inside of me!

I believe-
That God has a plan for all of us.
I believe-
That plan involves
Me getting my own planet.
And I believe
That the current President of the church,
Thomas Monson, speaks, directly to God.
I am a Mormon and, dang it,
A Mormon just believes.

CHORUS
A Mormon just believes.

ELDER PRICE
I know that I must go and do-
The things my God commands.

CHORUS
Things my God commands.

ELDER PRICE
I realize now why he sent me here!
If you ask the Lord in faith
He will always answer you just believe
In him and have no fear.

GUARD
(spoken) General! We have an intruder! He just walked right into camp!

ELDER PRICE
I believe!!!
That Satan has a hold of you.
I believe!
That the Lord God has sent me here!
And I believe that in 1978 God changed his mind about black people!!

CHORUS
Black People!!

ELDER PRICE
You can be a Mormon!
A Mormon who just believes.

GENERAL
(spoken) The fuck is this?

ELDER PRICE
And now I can feel the excitement.
This is the moment I was born to do.
And I feel so incredible-
to be sharing my faith with you.
The scriptures say that if you ask in faith,
If you ask God himself you'll know.
But you must ask him without any doubt,
And let your spirit grow!

CHORUS
Let your spirit grow!

ELDER PRICE
I believe!
That God lives on a planet called Kolob!
I believe!
That Jesus has his own planet as well.
And I believe
That the Garden of Eden was in Jackson County, Missouri.

If you believe,
The Lord will reveal it.
And you'll know it's all true-
You'll just feel it.

You'll be a Mormon!!!
And by gosh-
A Mormon just belieeeeeeeeves!!!!
Oh, I believe!
I believe!

CHORUS
Believe!
