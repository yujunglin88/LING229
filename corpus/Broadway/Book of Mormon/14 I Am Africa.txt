ELDER MCKINLEY:
I am Africa...
I am Africa.
With the strength of the cheetah,
My native voice will ring...

ELDERS:
We are Africa!
We are the heartbeat of Africa!

ELDER SCHRADER:
With the rhino-

ELDER THOMAS:
The meerkat-

ELDER CHURCH:
The noble lion king-

ELDERS:
We are Africa!

We are the winds of the Serentgeti,
We are the sweat of the jungle man,
We are the tears of Nelson Mandela,
We are the lost boy of the Sudan.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
I am Africa!
Just like Bono! I am Africa!
I flew in here, and became one with
This land!

ELDERS:
Ha na heya! Za ba neyba!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:

No, now Im frickin Africa!
With my Zulu spear,
I run barefoot through the sand!
I am Africa!

ELDERS:
Ha na heya za ba ney...

We are Africa
We are the, the only Africa
(The one and only Africa)
And the life we live is primitive
And proud!

(Let us smile and laughrica!)

We are Africa!
We are the deepest, darkest Africa!
(So deep and dark Africa)
We are the fields and fertile forests,
Well endowed!
We are Africa!

ELDER MCKINLEY:
We are the sunrise on the Savannah...

ELDER ZELDER:
A monkey with a banana...

ELDER CHURCH:
A tribal woman who doesnt wear a bra....

ELDERS:
Ahhhhh
Africans are African,
But we are A-
Frica!
