ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Im about to do it for the first time.
And Im gonna do it with a girl!
A special girl-
Who makes my heart kind of flutter-
Makes my eyes kind of blur-
I cant believe Im about
To baptize her!

NABULUNGI:
He will baptize me!
He will hold me in his arms,
And he will baptize me!
Right in front of everyone
And it will set me free-
When he looks into my eyes.
And he sees just how much
I love being baptized...

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Im gonna baptize her!

NABULUNGI:

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:

And I will baptize her-

NABULUNGI:

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:

And Ill make her beg for more,

NABULUNGI:

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
As I wash her free of sin.
And itll be so good,
Shell want me to

ELDER CUNNINGHAM and NABULUNGI:
Baptize her/me again.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Excuse me, Im gonna need another minute!

NABULUNGI:
Never known a boy to gentle,
One like him is hard to find.
A special kind.
Who makes my heart kind of flutter,
Like a moth in a cocoon.
I hope he gets to baptizin me soon!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:

NABULUNGI:
