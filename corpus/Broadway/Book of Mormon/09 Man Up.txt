ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
What did Jesus do,
When they sentanced him to die?
Did he try to run away?
Did he just break down and cry?

No, Jesus dug down deep,
Knowing what he had to do-
When faced with his own death,
Jesus knew that he had to...

Man up.
He had to man up.
So he crawled up on that cross,
And he stuck it out.
And he manned up.
Christ, he manned up.
And taught us all what real manning
Up is about!

And now its up to me
And its time to man up!
Jesus had his time ta,
Now its mine ta MAN UP!

Im taking the reins,
Im crossing the bear!
Just like Jesus,
Im growing a pair!
Ive gotta stand up,
Cant just clam up,
Its time ta-
MAN UP!

Cuz theres a time in your life
When you know youve got to
MAN UP.
Dont let it pass you by,
Theres just one time to
MAN UP.

Watch me man up like
Nobody else!
Im gonna man up all
Over myself!
Ive got to get ready,
Its time ta,
Time ta!

What did Jesus do
When they put nails in his hands?
Did he scream like a girl?
Or did he take it like a man?
When someone had to die
To save us from our sins,
Jesus said "Ill do it!"
And he took it on the chin!

He manned up!
He manned up,
He took a bullet for me and you,
Thats man up.
Real man up.
And now its my time ta...
DO IT TOO!

Time to be a hero
And slay the monster!
Time to battle darkness,
Youre not my father!
Im gonna time ta, just watch me go!
Time to stand up and steal the show!
Time ta! Mine ta!
Time ta! Time ta!
TIME TA.
