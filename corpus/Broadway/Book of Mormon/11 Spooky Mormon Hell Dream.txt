ELDER PRICE:
Long ago when I was five,
I snuck in the kitchen late at night
And ate a donut with a maple glaze.

My father asked who ate the snack
I said that it was my brother Jack,
And Jack got grounded for 14 days.

Ive lived with that guilt
All of my life
And the terrible vision
That I had that night!

No! Please, I dont wanna go baaaaaack!!!!

CHORUS:
Ha ha ha ha ha!!!

Down, down thy soul is cast!
From the Earth whenceforth ye fell!
THe path of fire leades thee to
Spooky Mormon Hell Dream!
