ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Id do anything for you. Im your best friend.

ELDER PRICE:
Well, alright then. Lets get some sleep, huh?

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Yeah... So tired....

Sleep now, little buddy,
Throw your cares away.
Nappy with a happy face,
Tomorrows a latter day.

ELDER PRICE:
What are you doing?

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Im just trying to make you feel better!

ELDER PRICE:
I feel fine.... But this is what Im talking out Elder, out focus needs to be on our work.
Do you understand how difficult this is gonna be?
The missionaries here have yet to baptize a SINGLE person to the chruch.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Well, if they had already baptized a bunch of Africans here,
then it wounlt be so incredible when YOU did it, now would it?

ELDER PRICE:
I guess.... I guess thats kind of true....

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Dont forget what you told me! You are awesome!
Together, were gonna bring LOTS of Africans to the church!
And my Dad will finally feel proud of me... instead of just feeling "stuck" with me....

ELDER PRICE:
You know what, Elder? I think your Dads got plenty to be proud of already.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Really?!

ELDER PRICE:
Yeah!

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Evening star shines brightly,
God makes like anew!
Tomorrow is a latter day,
And I am here for you.

ELDER PRICE:
I am here for you, too.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM and ELDER PRICE:
We are here
For us.

ELDER CUNNINGHAM:
Goodnight, best friend!

ELDER PRICE:
Goodnight, pal.
