TIMON:
I can see what's happening

PUMBAA:
What?

TIMON:
And they don't have a clue

PUMBAA:
Who?

TIMON:
They'll fall in love
And here's the bottom line
Our trio's down to two

PUMBAA:
Oh

TIMON:
The sweet caress of twilight
There's magic everywhere
And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disaster's in the air!

ENSEMBLE:
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world for once in perfect harmony
With all its living things

SIMBA:
So many things to tell her
But how to make her see
The truth about my past, impossible
She'd turn away from me

NALA:
He's holding back, he's hiding
But what, I can't decide
Why won't he be the king I know he is?
The king I see inside?

NALA, SIMBA:
Can you feel the love tonight?
The peace the evening brings
The world for once in perfect harmony
With all its living things

Can you feel the love tonight?
You needn't look too far
Stealing through the night's uncertainties
Love is where we are

NALA:
And if he feels the love tonight
In the way I do

SIMBA:
It's enough for this restless wanderer

SIMBA, NALA:
Just to be with you
