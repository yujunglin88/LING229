SCAR (spoken):
Zazu, why am I not loved?

(sung)
I am that rare and awesome thing
I'm every inch a king
Yet, I feel a twinge of doubt
As I go walk about

HYENAS (spoken):
Hey, boss!

SCAR:
When my name is whispered through the pride
Is this talk of love or regicide?

SHENZI (spoken):
Reggie who?

SCAR:
Tell me I'm adored
Please tell me I'm adored

HYENAS (spoken):
Hey, boss!

SCAR (spoken):
Oh, what is it?

BANZAI (spoken):
We got a bone to pick with you

SHENZI (spoken):
There's no food, no water

BANZAI (spoken):
Yeah. It's dinnertime, and there ain't no stinkin' entrees!

SCAR (spoken):
Oh, you and your petty complaints. You don't know what real hunger is.
Day after day it gnaws at the very core of my being -

BANZAI (spoken):
I had that once. It was worms

SCAR (spoken):
No, no, no... it's like an itch... deep, persistent, profound

BANZAI (spoken):
That's it - worms! When they get really bad all you gotta do is hunker down and scoot -

SCAR (spoken):
Thanks for the tip. Ingrates!
If it weren't for me you'd be beating off buzzards for your next bite!

HYENAS:
Yeah, you're our savior, thanks a bunch
But how about some lunch?
It doesn't matter if it's fresh
I need a fix of flesh
My bones have moved to where they've never been
They are on the outside looking in

SCAR (spoken):
Are you blaming me?

HYENAS (spoken):
Oh no, it's the lionesses

(sung)
You are so adored
Oh, you are so adored

SCAR (spoken):
That's more like it!

HYENAS:
But what I'd give for one more hit
Of wildebeest kielbasa
Or maybe hornbill on a spit

ZAZU (spoken):
Oh, how I miss Mufasa!

SCAR (spoken):
Mufasa?! Mufasa?! How dare you! I told you never to mention that name!

ZAZU (spoken):
Note taken. I shall never mention "M-m-m" again!

SCAR (spoken):
Even in death, his shadow looms over me.
There he is! No! There he is! And there!

ZAZU (spoken):
Calm yourself, sire, or you'll get another one of your splitting headaches!

SCAR (spoken):
I am perfectly fine!

(sung)
I'm better than Mufasa was
I'm revered - I am reviled
I'm idolized - I am despised
I'm keeping calm - I'm going wild!

I tell myself I'm fine
Yes, I am - no you're not
Yes, I am - no you're not
I tell myself I'm fine

No, you're not - yes, I am!
No, you're not - yes, I am!
No, you're not
Yes, no, yes, no
Who am I talking to?
Ah ha ha ha!

ZAZU (spoken):
Oh, pull yourself together, sire!

SCAR (spoken):
Oh, very well. Zazu? Zazu, Zazu, Zazu?

ZAZU (spoken):
Yes, sire?

SCAR (spoken):
Nobody loved me, there's the rub. Not even as a cub!
What did my brother have that I don't have?

ZAZU (spoken):
Do you want the short list or the long?

SCAR (spoken):
Whatever!

ZAZU (spoken):
Well, he had adoring subjects

SCAR (spoken):
No

ZAZU (spoken):
A loving family

SCAR (spoken):
No

ZAZU (spoken):
A devoted queen

SCAR (spoken):
That's it! I need a queen!

ZAZU (spoken):
A what?

SCAR (spoken):
A queen, man! A queen! Without a queen, what am I? A dead end, no line,
no descendants, no future. With a queen, I'll have... cubs!
Immortality will be mine! Immortality will be mine!

NALA (spoken):
Scar...

SCAR (spoken):
Ah, Nala... your timing couldn't have been more perfect. My, how you've grown...

NALA (spoken):
Scar, you have got to do something. We're being forced to overhunt

SCAR:
She's got those assets feminine

NALA (spoken):
You're the king. Control the hyenas

SCAR:
I have to make her mine

NALA (spoken):
You're destroying the Pride Lands

SCAR:
Nobility in every gene

NALA (spoken):
If we don't stop now... Don't you see?

SCAR:
She has to be my queen

NALA (spoken):
There's still a chance for things to be all right again

SCAR:
Come, sweet Nala
It's written in the stars

NALA (spoken):
What are you doing? Are you listening to me?

SCAR:
We'll create a host of little Scars

NALA (spoken):
What are you talking about?

SCAR:
Tell me I'm adored

NALA (spoken):
Get away from me!

SCAR:
Tell me I'm adored -

(NALA strikes SCAR.)

SCAR:
Oh, Nala... you know how I loathe violence... One way or another, you will be mine

NALA:
Never, Scar. Never!

SCAR:
You belong to me
You all belong to me!
