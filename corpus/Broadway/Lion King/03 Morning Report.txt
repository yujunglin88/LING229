ZAZU:
It's an honor and a privilege, a duty I perform
With due sense of decorum and with pride
With deference and great respect very much the norm
Plus a hint of sycophancy on the side
To lay before my ruler all the facts about his realm
To fill him in on all the beastly news

MUFASA (spoken):
Yes, yes, Zazu, get on with it!

ZAZU:
In order that His Majesty stands sturdy at the helm
Aware of all the fauna's latest views

MUFASA (spoken):
Zazu! The morning report!

ZAZU (spoken):
Er - yes, Sire: the morning report!

(sung)
Chimps are going ape
Giraffes remain above it all
Elephants remember
Though just what I can't recall
Crocodiles are snapping up
Fresh offers from the banks
Showed interest in my nest egg
But I quickly said, "No thanks!"
We haven't paid the hornbills
And the vultures have a hunch
Not everyone invited will be
Coming back from lunch

This is the morning report
Gives you the long and the short
Every grunt, roar, and snort
Not a tale I distort
On the morning report

MUFASA (spoken):
What are you doing, son?

YOUNG SIMBA (spoken):
Pouncing...

MUFASA (spoken):
Ah. Let an old pro show you how it's done

ZAZU:
The buffalo have got a beef

MUFASA:
Stay low
To the ground

ZAZU:
About this season's grass
Warthogs have been thwarted
In attempts to save their gas

SIMBA:
Yes, stay low

ZAZU:
Flamingoes in the pink

MUFASA:
Shh, not a sound

ZAZU:
Chasing secretary birds
Saffron is this season's color
Seen in all the herds

MUFASA:
Take it slow
One more step

ZAZU:
Moving down the rank and file
To near the bottom rung
Far too many beetles are
Quite frankly in the dung

MUFASA:
Then
POUNCE!

ZAZU:
AAAAHH!

YOUNG SIMBA:
This is the morning report
Gives you the long and the short
Every grunt, roar and snort
Not a tale I distort
On the morning report

ALL:
This is the morning report
Gives you the long and the short
Every grunt, roar and snort
Not a tale I distort
On the morning report
