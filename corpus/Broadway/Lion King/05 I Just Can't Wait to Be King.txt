YOUNG SIMBA:
I'm gonna be a mighty king, so enemies beware!

ZAZU:
Well I've never seen a king of beasts
With quite so little hair

YOUNG SIMBA:
I'm gonna be the mane event
Like no king was before
I'm brushing up on looking down
I'm working on my roar

ZAZU:
Thus far, a rather uninspiring thing

YOUNG SIMBA:
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

YOUNG SIMBA:
No one saying do this

ZAZU:
Now when I said that

YOUNG NALA:
No one saying be there

ZAZU:
What I meant was

YOUNG SIMBA:
No one saying stop that

ZAZU:
What you don't realize

YOUNG NALA/YOUNG SIMBA:
No one saying see here

ZAZU:
Now see here!

YOUNG NALA/YOUNG SIMBA:
Free to run around all day

ZAZU:
That's definitely out!

YOUNG SIMBA:
Free to do it all my way

ZAZU:
I think it's time that you and I
Arranged a heart-to-heart

YOUNG NALA:
Kings don't need advice
From little hornbills for a start

ZAZU:
If this is where the monarchy is headed
Count me out
Out of service, out of Africa
I wouldn't hang about
This child is getting wildly out of wing

YOUNG SIMBA:
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

Everybody look left

YOUNG NALA:
Everybody look right

YOUNG SIMBA:
Everywhere you look I'm

YOUNG NALA/YOUNG SIMBA:
Standing in the spotlight

ZAZU:
Not yet!

YOUNG NALA/YOUNG SIMBA:
Let every creature go for broke and sing
Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing
It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling

YOUNG SIMBA:
Oh, I just can't wait to be king!

YOUNG NALA:
Oh, he just can't wait to be king!

YOUNG SIMBA:
Oh, I just can't wait

YOUNG NALA:
Just can't wait

YOUNG NALA/YOUNG SIMBA:
To be king!
