BANZAI:
He called us slobbering!

SHENZI:
Said we were mangy!

BANZAI:
Did I hear stupid?

ED (spoken):
Huh?

BANZAI/SHENZI:
Tell us again, gee
It's so incredible

SHENZI:
That you're so rude

BANZAI:
When you're so edible

BANZAI/SHENZI:
When you are food!

BANZAI (spoken):
It's time to chow down

BANZAI/SHENZI (spoken):
Chow down!

(sung)
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chow down

SHENZI:
I'm chompin' at the bit, baby

BANZAI:
My stomach's on the growl, son

BANZAI/SHENZI:
Chow down!
Chow down!
You've both been invited on a date
Two courses handed to us on a plate
We'll have you raw, won't be long to wait

ALL:
Seeing you're already toasty brown
Chow down!
Ch-ch-ch-ch-ch-chow down!

BANZAI:
Your ribs are looking so tasty

SHENZI:
Such chewy little chops, chums

BANZAI/SHENZI:
Eat up!

SHENZI:
Now wasn't it her mom who ate your dad?

BANZAI/SHENZI:
And having parents eaten makes us mad

BANZAI:
We're gonna settle up the score a tad

BANZAI/SHENZI:
We've never had a snack of such renown
Chow down!
Chow down!

ED:
Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh-uh

SHENZI (spoken):
What, Ed? What is it?

BANZAI (spoken):
Hey, did we order this dinner to go?

SHENZI (spoken):
No -

BANZAI (spoken):
Well, there it goes!

BANZAI/SHENZI]
I think we should begin the meal from scratch
So many juicy segments to detach
Be good as gold for you're as good as carved

SHENZI (spoken):
Here, kitty kitty

BANZAI/SHENZI (spoken):
We're starved!
