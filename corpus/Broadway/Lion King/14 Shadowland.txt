LIONESSES:
Fatshe leso lea halalela
Fatshe leso lea halalela

NALA:
Shadowland
The leaves have fallen
This shadowed land
This was our home
The river's dry
The ground has broken
So I must go
Now I must go

And where the journey may lead me
Let your prayers be my guide
I cannot stay here, my family
But I'll remember my pride

LIONESSES:
Prideland

NALA:
I have no choice

LIONESSES:
My land

NALA:
I will find my way
Lea halalela

LIONESSES:
Tear-stained
Dry land
Take this

NALA:
Take this prayer

LIONESSES:
With you

NALA:
What lies out there

LIONESSES:
Fatshe leso

NALA:
Lea halalela

LIONESSES:
And where the journey may lead you
Let this prayer be your guide
Though it may take you so far away
Always remember your pride

(RAFIKI prays over NALA)

Always remember your pride
