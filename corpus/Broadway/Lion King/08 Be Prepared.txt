SCAR (spoken):
I never thought hyenas essential
They're crude and unspeakably plain
But maybe they've a glimmer of potential
If allied to my vision and brain

SCAR:
I know that your powers of retention
Are as wet as a warthog's backside
But thick as you are, pay attention
My words are a matter of pride

It's clear from your vacant expressions
The lights are not all on upstairs
But we're talking kings and successions
Even you can't be caught unawares

So prepare for a chance of a lifetime
Be prepared for sensational news
A shining new era
Is tiptoeing nearer

SHENZI:
And where do we feature?

SCAR:
Just listen to teacher!
I know it sounds sordid
But you'll be rewarded
When at last I am given my dues
And injustice deliciously squared
Be prepared!

BANZAI (spoken):
Yeah! Be prepared. We'll be prepared. For what?

SCAR (spoken):
For the death of the king!

BANZAI (spoken):
Is he sick?

SCAR (spoken):
No, fool! We're going to kill him... and Simba too!

SHENZI (spoken):
Great idea! Who needs a king?

BANZAI, SHENZI (spoken):
No king! No king! La la la la la la!

SCAR (spoken):
Idiots! There will be a king!

BANZAI (spoken):
But you said...

SCAR (spoken):
I will be king! Stick with me, and you'll never go hungry again!

BANZAI, SHENZI (spoken):
Yay, all right! Long live the king! Long live the king!

HYENAS:
It's great that we'll soon be connected
With a king who'll be all-time adored

SCAR:
Of course, quid pro quo, you're expected
To take certain duties on board
The future is littered with prizes
And though I'm the main addressee
The point that I must emphasize is
You won't get a sniff without me!

HYENAS, SCAR:
So prepare for the coup of the century

SCAR:
Be prepared for the murkiest scam
Meticulous planning
Tenacity spanning
Decades of denial
Is simply why I'll

HYENAS:
Ooo!
We'll have food!
Lots of food
We repeat
Endless meat

SCAR:
Be king undisputed
Respected, saluted
And seen for the wonder I am
Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared

SCAR, HYENAS:
Be prepared!
Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared
Be prepared!
