[ELIZA]
I saved every letter you wrote me
From the moment I read them I knew you were mine
You said you were mine
I thought you were mine
Do you know what Angelica said when we saw your first letter arrive?
She said be careful with that one love, he will do what it takes to survive
You and your words flooded my senses
Your sentences left me defenseless,
You built me palaces of paragraphs,
You built cathedrals.
I?m re reading the letters you wrote me
I?m searching and scanning for answers in every line
For some kind of sign
And when you were mine
The world seemed to burn, burn.
You published the letters she wrote you.
You told the whole world how you brought this girl into our bed.
In clearing your name you have ruined our lives.
Do you know Angelica said when she read what you?d done?
She said you?ve married Icarus; he has flown to close to the sun.
You and your words, obsessed with your legacy,
Your sentences border on senseless,
And you are paranoid at every paragraph how they perceive you
You, you, you.
I?m erasing myself from the narrative.
When future historians wonder how Liza reacted
When you broke her heart.
You have torn it all apart
I?m watching it burn,
Watching it burn.
The world has no right to my heart.
The world has no place in our bed.
They don?t get to know what I said.
I?m burning the memories,
Burning the letters that might have redeemed you
You forfeit all rights to my heart.
You forfeit the place in our bed,
You?ll sleep in your office instead
With only memories of when you were mine.
I hope that you burn.
