[CHOIRS]
The Battle of Yorktown.
Seventeen Eighty-one.

[LAFAYETTE]
Monsieur Hamilton.

[HAMILTON]
Monsieur Lafayette.

[LAFAYETTE]
In command where you belong.

[HAMILTON]
Are you saying, 'No Sweat''
We're finally on the field,
We've had quite a run.

[LAFAYETTE]
Immigrants'

[BOTH]
We get the job done!

[HAMILTON]
So what happens if we win'

[LAFAYETTE]
I go back to France.
I bring freedom to me people,
If I'm given the chance.

[HAMILTON]
We'll be with you when you do.

[LAFAYETTE]
Go lead your men.

[HAMILTON]
I'll see you on the other side.

[LAFAYETTE]
'Till we meet again.

[HAMILTON]
I am not throwing away my shot!
I am not throwing away my shot!
Yo, I'm just like my country,
I'm young, scrappy, and hungry,
And I am not throwing away my shot!

[CHOIRS]
I am not throwing away my shot!

[HAMILTON]
('Till the world turns upside down.)

[CHOIRS]
'Till the world turns upside down'

[HAMILTON]
I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory.
This is where it gets me,
On my feet, the enemy ahead of me.
If this is the end of me,
At least I have a friend with me.
Weapon in my head,
In command of my men with me.

Then I remember my Eliza's expecting me,
Not only that, my Eliza's expecting.
You gotta go,
Gotta get the job done,
Gotta start a new nation,
Gotta meet my son.

Get yo bullets out yo guns,
Get yo bullets out yo guns.
We move under cover,
And we move as one.
Through the night we have one shot to live another day.
We can not let a stray gunshot give us away.

We will fight up close,
Seize the moment and stay in it.
It's either that or meet the business end of a bayonet.
The code word is, 'Ro-Sham-Bo.'
Dig me'

[CHOIRS]
Ro-Sham-Bo!

[HAMILTON]
You have your orders now,
Go man, go!

And so the American experiment begins,
With my friends all scattered to the winds,
Laurens is South Carolina,
Redefining bravery.
We'll never be free until we end slavery.

When we finally drive the British away,
Lafayette is there waiting,
In Chesapeake Bay.

How did we know that this plan would work'
We had a spy on the inside,
That's right:

[CHOIRS]
Hercules Mulligan!

[MULLIGAN]
Tell I'm spying on the British Government,
I take the measurement information and then I smuggle it,
To my brothers, revolutionary coming in,
I'm running with the sons of liberty and I am loving it!

See that's what happens when you're up against the ruffians.
We in the s*** now,
Somebody gotta shovel it.

Hercules Mulligan,
I need no introduction,
When you knock me down,
I get the f*** back up again!

**Record Scratch Break**

[HAMILTON]
After a week of fighting,
A young man in a red coat stands on a parapet.

[LAFAYETTE]
We lower our guns as he frantically waves a white handkerchief.

[MULLIGAN]
And just like that it's over,
We tend to our wounded,
We count our dead.

[LAURENS]
Black and White soldiers wonder alike if this really means freedom.

[KING GEORGE]
Not yet.

[HAMILTON]
We negotiate the terms of surrender.
I see George Washington smile.
We escort their men out of Yorktown.
They stagger home, single file.
Tens of thousands of people flood the streets,
There are screams and church bells ringing.
And as our fallen foes retreat,
I hear the drinking song they're singing.

[CHOIRS]
The world turned upside down.
The world turned upside down.
The world turned upside down.
The world turned upside down, down...
Down, down, down!

[LAFAYETTE]
Freedom for America,
Freedom for France!

[CHOIRS]
Down, down, down!

[HAMILTON]
Gotta start a new nation,
Gotta meet my son!

[CHOIRS]
Down, down, down!

[LAURENS]
We won!

[MULLIGAN]
We won!

[LAFAYETTE]
We won!

[HAMILTON]
We won!

[CHOIRS]
The world turned upside...

Down!
