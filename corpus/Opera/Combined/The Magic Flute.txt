ACT I, Scene 1 A Mythical Wood
#1 QUARTET, TAMINO & 3 LADIES
TAMINO
Oh help me! Oh, help me! My life is in danger!
Oh help me! Oh, help me! My life is in danger!
The venomous monster is drawing upon me
And I can’t escape him.
How near is his bite,
With teeth sharp and white!
Oh gods above!
Why can’t you hear my mortal cry?
Destroy the beast or I will die!
Or surely, I will die!
THREE LADIES
Die, evil dragon, feel our might!
Hurrah! Hurrah! Our power conquers once again!
This man shall live.
His gratitude, his gratitude he will give.
1ST LADY
Such handsome features, shining hair!
2ND LADY
Such manly beauty is too rare!
3RD LADY
I’d kiss his lips, did I but dare!
THREE LADIES
If I were free to fall in love,
My hand this youth is worthy of.
But since our queen we must be serving,
From our strict oath we’ll not be swerving.
His youth and strength may suit her well
So now this news to her we’ll tell.
1ST LADY
Why don’t you two go on
I’ll watch him while you’re gone.

2ND LADY
No, no, he’s my concern
Besides, it’s not your turn.
3RD LADY
No, both of you are wrong,
Why don’t you run along?
1ST LADY
I’ll watch him while you’re gone.
2ND LADY
I’m sure it is my turn.
3RD LADY
Why don’t you run along?
1ST LADY
I’ll watch him!
2ND LADY
I’ll take him!
3RD LADY
I’ll have him!
1ST LADY
I!
2ND LADY
I!
3RD LADY
I!
2ND LADY
Someone must go!
1ST LADY
Someone must go!
3RD LADY
Someone must go!
Not I!

2ND LADY
Not I!
1ST LADY
Not I!
THREE LADIES
No, no, not I! Not I! No, no, not I!
In one another we’ve no trust. We’ve got no trust.
1St
 LADY
Not us!
2ND & 3RD LADIES
Not us!
THREE LADIES
We ladies know our lust.
THREE LADIES
I wish these two would now be going.
For then my love I could be showing.
If I could be with him alone.
If I could be with him alone.
Oh what’s the use?
They’ll ever go!
If I can’t have him, nor will they.
No one can stay!
Goodbye my love, you’ll never know
What might have been, since I must go!
Some day we’ll meet again.
Some day we’ll meet again.
Etc.
TAM:
Where am I? The dragon!! It's dead. Did I kill it? No, it's not possible.
But if I didn't, who did?
(at this moment, Papageno appears, playing the pan pipes and singing).

#2 ARIA, PAPAGENO
PAPAGENO

I’m the bird collector, as you see,
and I’m always happy as can be.
In this profession, there’s no man
who catches birds the way I can.
When the time to catch a bird is ripe,
I play a melody upon my pipe.
The birds fly right into my nets
and that’s why I’m a big success.

I’d like to use my skill to snare
a pretty maid with golden hair.
I’d plant some things for her to find,
then catch her quickly from behind.
And then I'd give her a great big kiss,
and spend my life in wedded bliss.
It sounds like that would work quite well;
until you try, you cannot tell.

TAM: Hey, there!
PAP: Ahh! Don't shoot! I don't have any money. All I have is two finches, a
wren and a yellow-tailed kestral. Isn't that a yellow-tailed kestral?
TAM: It's a sparrow
PAP: Oh— a sparrow. But you can have them.
TAM: Relax, friend.— I'm no highwayman. Prince Tamino is my name.
(takes his hand and shakes it)
PAP: Prince Tamino? I never heard of you. I know all the princes
around here.
TAM: Ah, but I'm not from around here. Tell me, do all of the people in this
country look like you?

PAP: Like me? NO-O-O. Most of them are homely.
TAM: That's a very unusual costume. Are you a native dancer?
PAP: A dancer? I'll have you know that I'm a member of a very old and
respected profession. My business is birds. (showing birds)
TAM: Ah, an ornithologist.
PAP: Say, be careful what you call me, fellow. I have the strength of ten men!
LADIES: (offstage) Papageno!
PAP: (startled) Whoops!
TAM: What's that?
PAP: Nothing, nothing. Just somebody who wants to buy my birds, maybe.
TAM: Oh, you sell your birds. To whom?
PAP: Well, (loudly) TO TELL THE TRUTH, I only sell my birds to the Queen
of the Night.
TAM: The Queen of the Night? You've seen her?
PAP: Naturally! She and I are like this! (makes gesture with fingers)
LADIES: (offstage) Papageno!
PAP: I didn't mean it! More like this. (puts his arms wide apart)
TAM: Who is this that calls?
PAP: The Queen's Ladies in Waiting. They’re always after me... I mean. after
my birds. I wish they’d tell me when they're coming. (looks around)
TAM: What's the matter? Are you afraid of something?
PAP: Afraid? Me? Why, I'll have you know that as bird collectors go, I'm the
bravest... (looks around) I think I might be the bravest of the lot!
(gestures as if asking approval from the sky)
TAM: Ah, then it was you who killed the dragon.

PAP: The...dragon..? What dragon? (turns around) YIII! Oh! My, that's a big
one! Stay, boy.
TAM: How did you do it? You have not a single weapon.
PAP: No... that's right. I don't have any weapons. (putting on bravery) I don't
need weapons. I... uh.. have this! (pulls out his pan pipes)
TAM: You killed him with that?
PAP: Uh.. well...not exactly. I called him with this. That's right. Then I
smacked him one.
LADIES: (nearer) Papageno!
PAP: (shrinks) No, that's not how it was... I mean, that's not what killed him.
TAM: Then what was it? Tell me, man!
PAP: What was it? (pulls Tamino aside) Don't tell anybody... I did it with magic!
1ST LADY: (entering) PAPAGENO!
2ND LADY: (entering) PAPAGENO!
3RD LADY: (entering) PAPAGENO!
PAP: Oh, no! I'm done for!
1ST L: Papageno! What did we tell you about lying?
2ND L: The Queen does not tolerate lying... in her subjects.
3RD L: And so you must be punished! (she padlocks his mouth)
PAP: Hmmm! Hmmm!
1ST L: Prince, it was we who saved you.
2ND L: Not this braggart!
3RD L: Not this coward!
TAM: (incredulous) You!

1ST L: We are the emissaries of her majesty, the Queen of the Night.
2ND L: We are very powerful.
3RD L: We were sent by her highness to save you, Prince Tamino.
TAM: You know my name.
1ST L: We know much about you, prince.
2ND L: (knowingly) Very much!
3RD L: (seductively) But not as much as we would like to know...
1ST L: Back! I will speak.
2ND L: No, I!
3RD L: No, I!
TAM: Ladies. I'm very grateful to you all. But why should the Queen of the
Night wish to save me?
1ST L: She is in great distress...
2ND L: ....and she needs the help of a noble young man...
3RD L: ...to rescue her daughter (shows him a portrait of Pamina)
#3 ARIA, TAMINO
TAMINO
Oh, portrait of a face divine!
Her ev’ry feature seems to shine.
I feel it! I feel it! Like the dawn of day,
That fills my heart with warming ray.
And now I feel an ardent yearning,
That deep within my soul is burning.
What is this feeling all unknown?
What is this feeling all unknown

Ah, yes! It’s love and love alone.
It’s love… it’s love… it’s love alone.
If I can ever hope to find her,
Then to my breast my arms would bind her.
I’d hold her… hold her… not let go.
Why hold her so?
I dread that ever
Love’s bond would sever,
And that my whole live long I would never…
Would never see her face once more.
Would never see her face once more.
Never see her face once more.
TAM: But, dear ladies, tell me, what has happened to... (indicating picture)
1ST L: Pamina.
TAM: (longingly, to picture) Pamina.
2ND L: An evil sorcerer snatched her away. His name is...
3RD L: ...Sarastro. His fortress is at the foot of the mountains, beyond...
1ST L: ... the forest. It is well guarded. And he watches for the Queen
to come. His magic is a match for hers.
TAM: Then what can I do? I am only a man and have no magic.
2ND L: Ah, but you are a royal prince, and Sarastro would not dare to kill
someone of your stature.
3RD L: Which is why someone as common as this cannot save her.
1ST L: Among other reasons...
(thunder and lightning)
TAM: Gods! What is that?

1ST L: The Queen! She comes!
2ND L: She comes!
3RD L: She comes!
#4 ARIA, QUEEN OF THE NIGHT
QUEEN OF THE NIGHT
I seek your aid, oh valiant son.
I need your courage, honor, strength.
And so to you I turn, in desperation,
to save my daughter pure from degradation.
This mother’s heart is cruelly broken,
now sweet Pamina’s torn away.
Since then no word to her I’ve spoken.
There’s been no word, no sign or token.
I’m all alone... I’m all alone since that vile day.
I think of her and wonder:
whose power is she under?
I hear still her calling;
her terror appalling.
Her cry within my heart is frozen:
“Ah, help! Ah, help!”
And then she spoke no more.
Yet I am sure Sarastro holds her...
a wicked tyrant none may implore.
Come, come, come!
For only you can save her.
Find her, return my child to me!
Yes! Find her, return my child to me.
And in return, you’ll find me grateful.
I’ll give her heart and hand to you.
I’ll give her heart–––––––
and hand––––– to you.

TAM: Truly an astonishing woman!
PAP: Mmm, hmm.
TAM: Ladies! I am determined! Lead on!
PAP: (anxiously) Hmmm! Hmmm!
TAM: Oh, that's right! I forgot about you, old fellow.
#5 QUINTET, TAMINO, PAPAGENO, 3 LADIES
PAPAGENO
Hm, hm, hm, hm, etc.
TAMINO
Of all the people to be speechless,
My friend, this must be hard on you.
PAPAGENO
Hm, hm, hm, hm, etc.
TAMINO
I know you want me to release you
But there is nothing I can do.
If I were able,
I would release you
But there is nothing I can do.
PAPAGENO
Hm, hm, hm, hm, etc.
1ST
 LADY
Your tongue our lady will restore
If you agree to lie no more.
PAPAGENO
Oh, joy! Now I am free to chatter!
2ND LADY
Your lying’s not a laughing matter.

PAPAGENO
But what if I exaggerate?
THREE LADIES
From little lies are born the great!
If you forget, the queen you’ll aggravate.
ALL FIVE
If we could stop, with such devices
All lying tongues that cause such pain,
We’d save the world from falsehood’s vices.
In ev’ry country peace would reign.
1ST
 LADY
Oh, Prince… to help you through this test,
Accept our majesty’s bequest.
The magic flute is your protection
From perils placed in your direction.
THREE LADIES
A mighty charm to you she’s granted
If you but sound its tones enchanted.
All sadness turns to rousing cheer;
Hypocrisy to truth sincere.
More than gold or silver
This gift has worth beyond compare.
Music means as much to man
As does light and earth and air.
PAPAGENO
Now that’s nicely taken care of…
Ladies, please excuse me…
THREE LADIES
Papageno, what’s your hurry?
You have nothing much to do.
You will make a fine addition
To the prince’s noble mission.
PAPAGENO
To Sarastro’s temple? No!
That’s a place I’ll never go.
For in terror it abounds

Of Sarastro fear would fill me,
That he’d catch me and he’d kill me.
Then he’d throw me to the hounds!
THREE LADIES
Be brave, the prince will be there too.
No harm can come when he’s with you.
PAPAGENO
Why can’t the prince go on alone?
I’d rather catch a bird.
I just don’t like to go on missions.
Really, that’s my final word.
1ST
 LADY
This gift, perhaps, will change your mind.
PAPAGENO
A box? It’s from her majesty…
THREE LADIES
For you the magic bells we’re bringing…
PAPAGENO
I want to set these bells a-ringing…
ALL
Bells enchanted… flute of magic…
All resistance falls before them!
Off you/we go, for strong your/our trust,
Both in pow’r and cause that’s just.
PAPAGENO
But there’s still one thing I must know…
TAMINO
In which direction should we go?
PAPAGENO, TAMINO
How should we go?
We’d better know which way to go.
THREE LADIES
Three children, wise as any sages,

Will guide you well, despite their ages.
To their advice attention pay,
Else you will surely lose your way.
PAPAGENO, TAMINO
Three children, wise as any sages,
Will guide you well, despite their ages.
THREE LADIES
To their advice attention pay,
Else you will surely lose your way.
PAPAGENO, TAMINO
And so, with valor of a hundred men,
We now depart this forest glen.
THREE LADIES
In triumph we will hail you then.
Farewell until we meet again.
ALL
We’ll meet again. We’ll meet again.
SCENE II, A ROOM IN SARASTRO'S PALACE
#6 TRIO, MONOSTATOS, PAMINA AND PAPAGENO
MONOSTATOS
Ah, not so fast, my pretty maid!
PAM
Of you I’m not at all afraid!
MONOSTATOS
You’ll learn in time to like me.
PAM
Not even if you strike me!
Oh, when my mother comes for me

She’ll make you pay,
And then you’ll see.
MONOSTATOS
You want to know the way it is?
Your mother is not coming
PAM
You’re lying, lying, lying!
I’ll not hear another word you say.
MONOSTATOS
Come here! Come here!
Now I will have my way.
PAPAGENO
I’m lost again… where am I now?
Ah, ha! I see some people. They’ll know their way around.
Good day to you, my friends.
Can you tell me where I’m standing?
MON & PAP
Ah! What kind of devil can he be?
With fear I’m sinking at the knee!
Have mercy! I beg of you
Hoo! Hoo! Etc.
(at the end of the trio, Monostatos runs off. Papageno starts to run off in
opposite direction, but runs directly into Pamina, who falls into his arms)
PAM: Thank you, friend, for saving me from that villain.
PAP: Saving you? Oh... yes... think nothing of it. That's what I'm
good at: collecting birds and saving girls. (looks around for the ladies)
Hmm.
Nice, thick walls. Soundproof...
PAM: I see you're in disguise. Did my mother send you?
PAP: Yes. I'm a personal envoy of the Queen of the Night. (looks around
again, gets much bolder) I am Papageno, Prince of Bird Catchers.
And this is not a disguise. This is my official uniform.
PAM: Bird catcher? My mother has sent a bird catcher?

PAP: Not a bird catcher. The king of bird catchers! But today I'm not
looking for birds! I'm looking for girls. I mean...(heroically) your
mother sent me to rescue you.
PAM: I knew she'd send someone for me. (hugs him) Let's go and escape!
PAP: (hesitatingly) Well, let's not be too hasty. There may be more of those
scary people running around here. We'd better wait for the Prince...
PAM: A Prince is coming?
PAP: Well, yes...
PAM: Is he handsome?
PAP: Not too bad, I guess. Almost as good-looking as I am.
PAM: Why is he coming for me? He does not know me.
PAP: No... But your mother gave him your picture.
PAM: She did? And because of that he is coming?
PAP: That's right. Crazy guys, these princes, eh?
PAM: Oh, no. It's wonderful. He must be wonderful!
PAP: He's all right, for a prince. But he doesn't know the forest at all.
He's following these three little boys...
PAM: He may get lost and be eaten by wild beasts! We must find him!
PAP: Now that's typical. No one ever worries about Papageno being eaten.
PAM: Oh, I'm sorry. You have no one? No girl friend?
PAP: Not a one. Though I can't imagine why.
PAM: Don't worry, Papageno. Just as I'm sure the Prince was meant
for me, I'm sure that you will find someone who is meant for you.

#7 DUET, PAMINA AND PAPAGENO
PAM:
If love is found in humankind,
a love for you is meant to be.
PAP:
I hope that love is truly blind,
or else how could it come to me?
BOTH:
For ev’ry heart, alone and sore,
in perfect time there beats one more,
In perfect time there beats one more
PAM:
It’s love that guides thru care and worry,
it steers the soul an even course.
PAP:
It calms the man in needless hurry,
for man it is the strongest force.
BOTH:
The path is clear for happy life.
Ev’rything starts with man and wife.
Ev’rything starts with man and wife.
Man and wife... and wife and man...
Man and wife, since time began,
were the heart of nature’s plan.
SCENE CHANGE BEFORE SCENE II (IF NEEDED)
(two slaves are seated, drinking together. The have brooms or other
cleaning implements. It is obvious that they are taking a long break.
They appear in a small lighted area before a dark curtain )
1ST SLAVE: It is good to have nothing to do. For a slave, that is heaven!
2ND SLAVE: Ha, ha, ha! It’s been two days since that girl escaped. Our
master could be gone a week... or a month. He’s lost Sarastro’s
prize and won’t dare return! Our sly, conniving Monostatos,

tricked by a woman. I’ll drink to him!
1ST SL: I heard he was trying to get friendly with her... against Sarastro’s
command. Tried to kiss her...
2ND SL: And he got a bowl of soup on his head instead.
I’ll drink to the thought of it.
1ST SL: Who is this girl?
2ND SL: I don’t know. I think she’s important. Maybe a Princess.
Monostastos will now get his reward from Sarastro...
1ST SL: Yes, a hanging in the courtyard! Ha, ha!
2ND SL: No, no, a beheading!
1ST SL: Better yet... how about a disembowelment?
2ND SL: Yes, Sarastro can be kind to him by curing his headaches and his
ulcers at the same time!
Ist SL: (sadly) He will be kind to him, won’t he? He’ll forgive him.
2ND SL: (sadly) Probably.
1ST SL: How can he forgive a common wretch, who, in gratitude for being
raised from the dirt and given so much, would turn on him in a
minute?
2ND SL: I can’t understand it. Maybe that’s why I’m a slave...
1ST SL: (hearing a commotion) What’s that? The master must be returning...
Look busy with that mop or he’ll beat you!
2ND SL: Me? Hah! Look at the windows...
(they rush off. The curtain rises on Scene II)
SCENE II, BEFORE THE THREE PORTALS TO SARASTRO'S TEMPLE

#8 FINALE, ACT 1
MAGIC BOYS
Thru forest dark we’ve shown the way.
Before the temple now you’re standing.
You’re on your own, keep this in mind:
Be silent, dauntless, undemanding.
TAM
But can you tell me, ere you go
How best to kill Pamina’s foe?
MAGIC BOYS
Such things are not for us to say.
Be silent, dauntless, undemanding.
In simple words: Just be a man!
To him the prize who has the valor.
TAM
Somehow the secret’s as they stated.
I won’t forget what they’ve related.
But how to start, now that I’m here?
What lies behind these walls severe?
What is the inscription engraved on this tower?
“Here reason and justice and wisdom are power.”
Long dead are the authors who made these words so fine;
And now nothing lives here but cowards and swine!
Enough of delaying! I’m going inside.
I’ll rescue Pamina and make her my bride.
Sarastro I have come to fight!
And save Pamina from her plight.
VOICES
Go back!
TAM
Go back! Go back?
Then here’s where I’ll attack!
VOICES
Go back!

TAM
More voices cry “go back!”
I’ll open this final door…
Perhaps I’ll here no warning there.
PRIEST 1
Who comes upon our door so late?
Why do you seek admission?
TAM
To truth and honor I am bound!
PRIEST 1
A very noble thing to be.
But stay! Perhaps you are mistaken?
Revenge and hate brought you here
While truth and honor you’ve forsaken.
TAM
Just hatred for a ravisher!
PRIEST 1
Then wrong the path that you have taken.
TAM
Sarastro’s not inside?
PRIEST 1
Oh, yes Sarastro dwells inside.
TAM
Inside this wise and holy place?
PRIEST 1
Among us, his the highest grace.
TAM
Then you are all as vile as he!
PRIEST 1
Yet still you’d enter here?

TAM
Yes, let me by, priest of hell!
All of you I defy!
PRIEST 1
Act not impulsively.
You’ll die for worthless cause.
TAM
Sarastro lives inside.
I’ll take no further pause.
PRIEST 1
If you would keep your life, be patient, tell me more.
Sarastro you would slay?
TAM
Death to the tyrant, yes!
PRIEST 1
But why so much hostility?
TAM
He is a monster and a thief!
PRIEST 1
And can you prove this accusation?
TAM
Her mother told me all about it.
Her tears and torment prove her grief.
PRIEST 1
Her ev’ry word you do believe?
The woman’s clever, no mistake;
Her mouth has venom like a snake.
But Sarastro will explain
What questions in your mind remain.
TAM
His motives should be all too clear.
I know he stole a helpless daughter
And here, without consent, he brought her.

PRIEST 1
That’s true. Sarastro has her here.
TAM
You know that? Tell me where she is!
My rescue may be yet in time…
PRIEST 1
Your time has not yet come to pass.
To tell you more is not allowed.
TAM
You can’t be silent. Tell me now!
PRIEST 1
I cannot break my sacred vow.
TAM
When will this vow be ever ended?
PRIEST 1
When you to us extend your hand,
And as a friend you join our band.
TAM
What must I think? It’s all confusion.
What is the truth and what illusion?
VOICES
Truth, truth one day you will know.
TAM
Truth? Truth? Just one thing I would know.
Is my Pamina still alive,
Or must she now be dead?
VOICES
Pamina is alive.
TAM
Alive? Alive! Thank God she’s still alive!
Could I but thank you for your kindness;
A light you’ve shone upon my blindness.
I’ll send my tones aloft for all to hear them.
Magic flute I will play!

(Plays the flute)
What might is in each magic note,
What sound enthralling!
No wild beast can remain unmoved
When joy to ev’ry heart is calling.
What might is in each magic note,
That no wild beast can remain unmoved
When joy to ev’ry heart is…
But not Pamina!
For Pamina’s far away.
Pamina, answer me!
Plays the flute
In vain, in vain!
How, how can I set you free?
Hears Papageno’s pan flute
Ah, that is Papageno’s call…
They play and answer each other
He heard my music loud and clear,
And so… and so… some sound may reach her ear!
PAM AND PAP
Running quickly, we have come
Where the sound is coming from.
For the prince must be nearby and
When we find him from Sarastro we will fly.
PAM
Oh, Tamino…
PAP
Quiet, quiet let me try it.
(Plays the pan pipe and hears a reply)
PAM AND PAP
We’re not far from Prince Tamino
For we hear his music nigh
Now to find him we will try.
With the magic music sounding,

Thru the forest we’ll be bounding, we’ll be bounding, we’ll be bounding.
MONOSTATOS
How astounding, how astounding!
Ha! Caught by your own design.
All your noise got my attention
And it’s led to apprehension, apprehension, apprehension.
Once again you’re in my power,
Silly bird and pretty flower.
Put the both of them in chains!
PAM AND PAP
Little hope for us remains.
MON
Put the both of them in chains!
PAP
There’s a chance, there’s a chance, there’s a chance for you and me.
While my hands I’ve still got free,
I will play the bells so brightly
They’ll unlock us most politely.
(Papageno plays his bells. The slaves drop their chains)
MON AND SLAVES
I’m feeling so giddy, so happy, so strange!
Lara la, la la, la, la, la… la, la, la, la!
It’s quite unexpected to make such a change.
Lara la, la la, la, la, la… la, la, la, la!
(They dance off as Papageno celebrates his success)
PAM AND PAP
What if ev’ry angry man
Had his heart set ringing?
Is there naught more pleasant than
Ev’rybody singing?
When a heart is full of song,
None may do another wrong.
Melody turns gall to glee,

Mockery to laughter.
And a happy man may be
What the world is after!
CHORUS OF PRIESTS
All hail to Sarastro, the Lord of Isis.
PAP
He comes to destroy us!
I’m trembling, I’m shaking.
PAM
There flies all hope of our escape.
Sarastro’s band are all about.
PAP
I wish I were a mouse,
Beneath the grasses sneaking…
Around a pine cone peeking
Then hiding in my house!
A lie… what lie shall we be speaking?
PAM
No falsehood. No falsehood!
Truth alone he’s seeking.
CHORUS OF PRIESTS
All hail to Sarastro, the High Priest of Isis.
He leads well his people thru trouble and crisis.
His wisdom is power and truth is his might.
Thru justice and mercy we learn what is right.
To glory eternal he shows us the light.
He shows us the light.
PAM
Sire, let me bare my guilty heart.
I tried my best to make escape.
This man is guilty of no crime;
He drove away that evil monster
Ere he could take me one more time.
SARASTRO
Arise. I pardon you, Pamina.
Although I hold you in this temple,
A pris’ner I’ll not have you be.

I know that love has found your heart.
Yes, has found your heart.
And yet, true happiness would fail you
If I too soon should set you free.
PAM
You say that love has called to me…
I hear my mother…
SAR
Do not speak her name!
That woman cries not out of love but rather hate and vengeance.
PAM
How can you say she does no love me?
My mother…
SAR
… is the Queen of Night!
And tho’ she may well love her daughter,
Her wicked heart can never give to you
The love of truth and honor.
(Monostatos enters, dragging Tamino)
MON
I caught this fellow by the door!
Get on your knees before our lord!
PAM
Tamino!
TAM
Pamina!
PAM
Tamino! My heart does pound!
TAM
Pamina! At last you’re found!
PAM
Are you as real as now you seem?

TAM
My darling! Is this all a dream?
BOTH
Oh happiness and joy supreme!
PRIESTS
Who are these people?
MON
Stop! That’s got to stop! It’s not permitted… except with me.
My Lord, your will is my endeavor.
Allow my sword his head to sever.
These two intruders now must die!
The queen has sent them here to spy.
Pamina I will fill with terror
Lest she repeat her little error.
You know me… I’m your good right hand.
SAR
What you deserve I understand!
What boon I give you’ll gladly take?
MON
A happy man of me you’ll make.
SAR
A hundred lashes at the stake!
MON
Oh, no! That wasn’t what I had in mind.
SAR
No more! I do it to be kind.
PRIESTS
All hail to Sarastro, in fairest tradition
His justice considers no wealth or position
SAR
These men believe our temple walls conceal an order strange and vile.
So they shall see with their own eyes as they complete our sacred trial.

PRIESTS
With virtue and unselfishness
The path of life is straight and free.
And leads to heaven’s golden door
From which a soul shall fall no more.
We take the path to heaven’s door
From which a soul shall fall no more.
Shall fall to the earth no more,
Shall fall no more.

ACT II, SCENE I A HALL INSIDE SARASTRO'S TEMPLE
#9 FANFARE
SAR: O worthy assemblage. I have decided to allow the prisoners to seek the
Truth, rather than be punished for the lack of it. Prince Tamino is to
undergo the Trials of the Will. If he can pass them all, he will have
shown he has the character to join our order and strive for truth
against the world's falsehoods. If he fails, he may die in the attempt.
1ST PRIEST: He seems worthy, lord. But what of his companion?
SAR: If he has worth, it shall be found.
#10 ARIA, SARASTRO
SAR
O gods of earth and gods of heaven,
I beg your presence on this day,
For two young men now seek our wisdom
And must be placed in danger’s way.
PRIESTS
They must be placed in danger’s way.
SAR
Grant them the will to resist temptation
And give them strength to find salvation.
Should they be worthy, they then shall find
Wisdom to share with all mankind.

PRIESTS
Wisdom to share with all mankind.
SCENE II, A SIMPLE ROOM IN THE TEMPLE, LATER
(Tamino and Papageno are led in by guards)
TAM: Papageno! Are you all right?
PAP: If being thrown into a dark room, starved and scared half to death
by large fellows in robes is all right, then I am extremely all right.
1ST PR: (coming up behind them) Brothers!
PAP: Yikes!
1ST PR: (looking disparagingly at Papageno, then to both) As you know, you
have been given the right to undergo the Trial of Will, rather than
suffer punishment for your transgressions. Is that your desire?
TAM: YES!
PAP: Uh... could you explain the Trial a bit, first?
2ND PR: You will face several ordeals which, if you succeed, will lead you to
truth and wisdom.
PAP: And if we fail?
1ST PR: Ultimately, death.
PAP: It sounds good, but I think I'll pass.
2ND PR: You do not seek truth and wisdom?
PAP: Well, no.... generally I seek birds.
2ND PR: Truth is also love. Would you find love?
TAM: Yes! (to himself) Pamina!
PAP: Well, you're getting warmer, but I don't know... that death part...
2ND PR: And if there were a wife for you, did you succeed, what then, man?

PAP: A wife? A real person?
2ND PR: Indeed. There is a maiden, meant just for you, that you shall find.
PAP: Meant just for me? What is her name?
2ND PR: Papagena.
PAP: Papagena. What a beautiful name! Can I see her?
1ST PR: If you resolve, you may see her. But you may not speak to her.
Nor may you, Tamino, speak to Pamina. This is your first trial.
PAP: Oh, well, that doesn't sound too bad. I'll do it!
2ND PR: You can remain silent? On penalty of death?
PAP: Absolutely. Not a word. Is she beautiful?
#11 DUET, IST AND 2ND PRIESTS
TWO PRIESTS
Your firm resolve must face flirtation
To gain a place within our noble band
You dare not listen to temptation
By women. You must make a stand,
Or else from glory they will turn you,
And bend your will to suit their own.
Refuse, and from their hearts they spurn you.
Death and dishonor yours alone.
1ST PR: Your Trial of Silence now begins.
(the lights go out, the priests vanish)
PAP: Oh, no! It's dark! (calling out) TAMINO!
TAM: Quiet, Papageno! Remember, silence!

#12 QUINTET, TAMINO, PAPAGENO, THE 3 LADIES
THREE LADIES
Why, why why did you let them lead you on?
Fly, fly, fly! From the temple get you gone.
Tamino, death is all they offer,
And pain shall Papageno suffer.
PAP
No, no, no, my knees go weak.
TAM
Papageno, do not speak.
If a word to them is spoken,
Just like that, your vow is broken.
PAP
But did you hear we might be killed?
TAM
Papageno, please be still!
THREE LADIES
If you go on, we’re quite afraid,
The Queen will feel she’s been betrayed.
PAP
The Queen… what will she do to me?
TAM
Papageno, please be still!
Can’t you ever stop the chatter?
What they tell you does not matter.
THREE LADIES
We hope you know the chance you’re taking.
An enemy of her you’re making
By joining with this evil band.
TAM
Their words and deeds have proven true.
The evil, then, must lie with you.

THREE LADIES
And if you brave their fine ordeal
The fires of hell you’re sure to feel.
PAP
Oh, I don’t want to, I don’t want to, , I don’t want to, I don’t want to
Go to hell! Tamino tell me, is that true?
TAM
These ladies say what they’ve been told.
Trust what I say, if you are bold.
PAP
But they are speaking for the Queen…
TAM
That she is false will soon be seen.
Be still, my word should be enough.
Pay them no mind, it’s all a bluff.
THREE LADIES
Why do you treat us now so badly,
When you must know we love you madly?
PAP
They love us madly? Me?
TAM
Still!
PAP
Yes, yes, I’ll try to be…
TAM
Still! Your mouth is always much in motion,
And it will be the death of you.
PAP
My mouth is always much in motion
And it will be the death of me.
THREE LADIES
What can we do? They will not answer.
We cannot make them break their vow.

PAP & TAM
What can they do? W will not answer.
They cannot make us break their vow.
ALL
Of men like this we’ve/they’ve never heard…
Who think before they say a word!
PRIESTS
These women are here uninvited!
What blasphemy have they incited?
THREE LADIES
Away! Away! Away!
PAP
They’ve gone! Oh, what a day!
1ST PR: Tamino, you have ably passed your first test. Be on your guard for
further tests of your will.
2ND PR: (to Papageno, cowering on the floor) Papageno, get up! Be a man.
PAP: I'd rather not. That's not part of the test. Do I get to see
Papagena now?
2ND PR: You are not yet ready.
PAP: You're going to keep me on a string, aren't you? That just goes
to show you... give a priest the upper hand and...
TAM: Papageno! Quiet!
PAP: Right. Quiet.

SCENE III— PAMINA'S ROOM IN THE TEMPLE
#13 ARIA, MONOSTATOS ( creeping near the sleeping Pamina)
MONOSTATOS
 There she is, my saucy beauty,
Standing well within my reach.
I’m a lover fresh and fruity
And I’ll pinch this juicy peach!
What a pair, in combination:
She’s so sweet and I’m so tart.
Now to sample all her sweetness,
I can’t wait to make a start.
 Why should I not have this treasure
That’s intended for a prince?
When an ugly man has pleasure,
Why does ev’rybody wince?
I’m a man and she’s a woman,
And the moon begins to rise.
If you think this sight is awful,
You can kindly close your eyes.
MON: She is so beautiful! I can't help it if I like beautiful things! This
time I'll tie a handkerchief over her mouth so I can quietly
carry her off where no one will find her. And then...
QUEEN: (appearing magically) Back, wretch! (she gestures, and he is thrown
back by invisible forces)
MON: Ahh! The Queen of the Night! (he recovers and scurries off,
 then hides behind a pillar and eavesdrops)
PAM: (waking) Mother!
QUEEN: Quiet, girl! Why has the prince I sent not rescued you? Where is he?
PAM: He is undergoing the trials.
QUEEN: That is not what I intended.

PAM: But when he succeeds, he will come for me, I'm sure...
QUEEN: No, that will not do. He is lost to you. He joins with the forces of
Sarastro against me. He has become my sworn enemy.
PAM: No!
QUEEN: Forget Tamino. You, yourself, must now defend me. You shall kill Sarastro!
PAM: I? I can't
QUEEN: You must! You are my daughter. Here is your weapon. Do not fail me!
#14 ARIA, QUEEN OF THE NIGHT (following which, she exits)
QUEEN OF THE NIGHT
Infernal wrath is raging deep inside me
Hell and damnation!
Hell and damnation’s fires burn in my eyes!
By your white hand Sarastro dies tomorrow,
Sarastro dies tomorrow,
or else I have no daughter ever more,
or else I have no daughter ever more,
Ah–––––––
My love you lose forever!
I’ll cast you out forever!
All hope is gone forever,
for my heart is dead to you!
Unloving, unchanging, unforgiving,
lest you strike this deadly blow!
lest you strike this deadly blow!
Take this in hand.
Avenge me on Sarastro.
Die, die, die, hated tyrant!
Hear a mother’s curse!
PAM: How can I do it? Sarastro does not seem to be an evil man. He is kind
and his judgments are fair. Yet my mother hates him. Why? Why?
MON: (coming out of hiding) Pretty maiden...

PAM: You! Get away! (brandishes knife)
MON: Calm yourself, beautiful maiden. I will not harm you. I can help you.
I can take care of everything.
PAM: What do you mean?
MON: Just because I am here, you think I am loyal to Sarastro?
I am here to help you and your mother destroy him.
PAM: How will you do this? Tell me.
MON: Oh, no. First you must promise me my reward.
PAM: And that is...
MON: Your hand in marriage, beautiful maiden.
PAM: What? Never!
MON: Then I’ll do nothing for you. You shall have do your mother’s bidding
and kill Sarastro!
PAM: No! (turns away)
SAR: (entering) Who is to be killed?
MON: (guiltily) Sire! The maiden plots against you. I have discovered her
treachery.
SAR: Thank you. Now you may go.
MON: Go? But for such a service I should receive a... (Sarastro glares at him)
Oh, of course. No reward, sire! No reward! Your safety is my best
reward. (scurries away, then stops momentarily) The daughter is blind
to my qualities. The mother will be more receptive. (exit)
PAM: My lord! He lies! He is not loyal to you.
SAR: I know, child.
PAM: And you do not hate him for it?
SAR: No, child.

PAM: But I... my mother...
SAR: Tell me no more! Those who hate me shall all receive the same
treatment.
#15 ARIA, SARASTRO
SARASTRO
 Within these halls of wisdom
All malice is unknown.
For love and understanding
Are scribed on ev’ry stone.
We welcome all whose hearts forgive,
Who turn aside all envy and hate.
By trust and honor must we live
Or we shall find truth’s light too late.
Too late, too late.
 Within this band, as no other,
Our bias we set aside.
As trusting sister and brother
Each one may here abide.
We teach that man cannot prosper all alone;
That selfish thought no profit imparts.
The greatest prize that man may own
Is his fond place in others’ hearts.
His place in others’ hearts.
SCENE IV THE SIMPLE ROOM IN THE TEMPLE. It is dark.
PAP: Tamino! Where are you?
TAM: Ssh!
PAP: Well, they didn't say I couldn't talk to you.
TAM: SSH!

PAP: All right, I'll talk to myself. That's allowed, I suppose? Sitting in the
dark, not talking to anyone, no food or drink...this must be the worst
trial! That girl had better be worth it... I hope I can get a peek at her
pretty soon... (an old woman enters with a tray and a chalice of water)
Hey! Here is someone. What have you there, old grandma?
PAPA: A refreshing drink for you, my angel.
PAP: For me? Why, thanks very much. Sorry, Tamino... I guess the gods
don't think you're worthy yet. Ha, ha! (drinks, then spits it out) Akk!
This is water!
PAPA: Yes, my angel.
PAP: Oh, I see. Another little trial, eh? Well, I can take it! (drinks) You see?
PAPA: Do you feel better, my angel?
PAP: No...I'm still bored. The time goes so slowly. Talk to me, grandma.
How long have you been here?
PAPA: Not long. A few minutes...
PAP: Ah... the gods have sent me a funny woman. I suppose you know a
lot of old jokes, too. How old are you, darling?
PAPA: Eighteen years and six minutes.
PAP: (repeating, incredulously) Eighty years and six minutes!
PAPA: No, no. Eighteen years and six minutes.
PAP: Oh, ho! Eighteen years and six minutes! Ha, ha! Then I'll bet
you have a boyfriend, too.
PAPA: (shyly) Yes, my angel.
PAP: I knew it! The cute, young girls are already taken! And how old
is this young spark?
PAPA: Only five years older than me.
PAP: Five? Well, he must be quite a fellow. What's his name, this
cradle robber?

PAPA: Papageno.
PAP: Pa...pa...ge...no...? How do you spell that? Never mind, I can't write.
What is he like?
PAPA: Oh, (looking at him) he has blue eyes... he is about so tall...
PAP: Yes...
PAPA: He is... almost handsome...
PAP: Almost...
PAPA: And he wears...
PAP: What?
PAPA: Feathers.
PAP: Feathers. FEATHERS? Where is this impersonator? This phony? This...
PAPA: (pointing at him) There.
PAP: Here. But I'm the only one here.
PAPA: Yes, my angel.
PAP: Me? I'm your boyfriend? Then you are the maiden the gods promised?
(she nods) That's it! (speaking to unseen priests) Look! I'm talking! Oh,
darn, I broke my vows. (Papagena leaves despondently)
Well, I'm ready to go... Where are you, priests?
#16 TRIO THE THREE BOYS (entering, bearing a sumptuous tray of food)
THE THREE BOYS
A second time we stand before you.
We’re glad to see you’ve come so far.
At journey’s end they will adore you
Who know what kind of man you are.
Tho’ magic charms protect and guide you,
Courage must be your truest friend.
If a third time we stand beside you,
Happy your story in the end

Tamino, soon, love will be found.
You, Papageno, not a sound!
No, no, not a sound.
PAP: All right, I'll be quiet until I finish eating. Then I'm talking my head off.
Tamino, look! Food!.
TAM: (shakes his head and plays the flute)
PAP: Oh, I forgot. You're being strong. Well, you do a few flute numbers
and I'll do the drinking and eating. (looking at a bottle)
Say, this is a good year...
PAM: (offstage) Tamino... (entering) Tamino! (she runs up to embrace him)
Sarastro told me where they were keeping you, and then I heard
your flute... What's the matter? Why don't you speak? (he gestures
her away) What? You want me to leave? I love you. (she tries to kiss
him, but he pulls away) How can this be? You now despise Pamina?
Why? What have I done? (sees Papageno) Papageno, tell me...
PAP: (his mouth full of food) MMMfffff. (he shrugs)
PAM: You too? Have all my friends deserted me?
#17 ARIA, PAMINA
PAM
What is wrong? Why are you silent?
Can it be that love is dead?
Has the golden love you promised
In your heart been turned to lead?
Oh, Tamino, do not shun me.
Tears are streaming from my eyes,
With them life from me is draining.
Care you not Pamina dies?
Pamina dies.

SAR: (entering) Tamino, you have done well so far. It is now time
for your final trial.
PAM: Sarastro. Tamino will not speak to me? What is wrong with him?
SAR: Nothing is wrong, child. Trust me. Now I must take Tamino away
from you.
PAM: Away? Where?
SAR: He must complete the most dangerous part of his trial. If he fails,
he may not return. You may wish him farewell.
PAM: He heart has already left me behind. He hates me.
SAR: No, child. He does not hate you. He was forbidden to speak. It was
part of his trial.
PAM: Then it is a horrible trial! First you would break our love, then you
would kill him! Why are you doing this?
SAR: It is my duty.
PAM: It is your duty? (looking again at her daggar) I, too, have a duty.
Tamino! Would you let this happen?
No. 18 CHORUS
PRIESTS
May our hopes for Tamino be triumphant!
As darkest night must fly before the sunlight,
So selfish thought dispels in honor’s presence.
In this young man we find a noble essence.
His will is strong, his heart is pure.
So, so, so our strict trial he will endure.

#19 TRIO, PAMINA, TAMINO, SARASTRO
(Sarastro leads Tamino out. Pamina stands forlorn, then runs off in
tears. Papageno is still eating.)
PAM
What dreadful task must he perform?
SAR
Now he must face both fire and storm.
PAM
My flute will guard and safely guide me.
PAM
I’ll worry ‘til you’re beside me.
TAM & SAR
My/his flute will guard and safely guide me/him.
Pam
To awful death you may be going.
I beg you, stay. You must not leave.
TAM & SAR
On fortune’s tide my/his life is flowing.
I/he must go on, so do not grieve.
PAM
If you could feel my pain and sorrow,
You’d know your death would break my heart.
TAM & SAR
I know we’ll/you’ll meet again tomorrow
And then we/you nevermore will part.
SAR
The time has come to end this meeting.
Tamino, onward you must go.
Now you must go,
Now you must go,

Our ways to know.
The time has come,
He’ll soon be with you.
PAM
Our time together was so fleeting.
Tamino, I can’t let you go.
Tamino, Tamino, now must you go?
Tamino, fare you well, ah!
My heart is with you, ah, is with you.
Fare you well.
TAM
Our time together was so fleeting.
Pamina, onward I must go.
Now I must go,
Fare you well, ah!
My heart is with you, ah, is with you.
Fare you well.
PAP: Tamino! Say, where is everybody? Don't leave me alone here...
(he runs toward the door, then remembers to go back and bring
the food, then runs again to the door Tamino and Sarastro exited.
He runs into the two priests)
1ST PR: Back!
PAP: YI! I don't want to go back! I'm leaving!
1ST PR: You are not yet worthy. You have failed our test.
PAP: What do you mean? I can keep as quiet as anyone. I’m hardly
talking now... Weren’t you listening before? I’m sure you were.
I said nothing to Pamina.
1ST PR: And I also heard you talk to everyone else.
PAP: No, I didn't! Well, I mean, that shouldn't count because I was
hungry. Now I'm full, so now I could...
1ST PR: Silence! You have earned the right to dwell in darkness all your life.
PAP: Well... Darkness? Say, why are you picking on me?
I'll bet there are a lot like me in the world.

2ND PR: That is true.
PAP: Then it's not fair to make me dwell in darkness while all of them
are out there blabbing away and eating...
2ND: PR: You have earned darkness, but it is not yet your fate. You may yet
gain the light. When you have learned the value of suffering for
something truly important, then you shall be worthy.
PAP: Suffering... I know you fellows are really big on suffering, but
where I come from... forget it. Couldn't you just say I was worthy
without the suffering?
2ND PR: Is nothing important to you? Have you no goals, no desires?
PAP: Well, sure...I'd like some more wine. And maybe some dessert...
2ND PR: Is that all you can think of?
PAP: Well, let's see... Oh, yes! There is one more thing...
#20 ARIA, PAPAGENO
PAPAGENO
 A pretty little maiden is all I want today.
I may want more tomorrow,
but what I cannot say.
If I had a woman so pretty,
I’d be a big man in the city.
My nose would be up in the air,
just walking with someone so fair.
If I had a woman so pretty,
My nose would be up in the air
just walking with someone so fair.
 A pretty little maiden is all I want today.
I may want more tomorrow,
but what I cannot say.

But then, upon further reflection,
it’s hard to expect such perfection.
A plain little darling will do.
to love me and always be true.
One cannot expect such perfection.
A plain little darling will do.
to love me and always be true.
 A pretty little maiden is all I want today.
I may want more tomorrow,
but what I cannot say.
She may not be all that good-looking,
and maybe I can’t eat her cooking...
So gallant a fellow am I,
I’ll take the next girl who goes by.
So gallant a fellow am I,
I’ll take the next girl who goes by…
The next girl who goes by.
1ST PR: Then see, Papageno, what you may gain... (the priests leave)
PAPA: Here I am, my angel.
PAP: (looking for priests) Oh, no! I didn't mean it! (calling off)
I'd rather have a dog!
PAPA: I will be yours forever. (hugging him)
PAP: Grandma, I don't know what those fellows have been telling you,
but I don't think we're right for each other...
PAPA: No one else can be yours, Papageno. I am the only woman
who can ever love you.
PAP: The only one?
PAPA: The only one.
PAP: Now is that fair, gods? I know you're picking on me because
I'm dressed like a bird...

PAPA: I like birds...
PAP: No, no... I wear feathers.
PAPA: I wear feathers.
PAP: You do? (he looks her over. She pulls out a feather from under her shawl)
Well, you're not much to look at, grandma, but I like you.
PAPA: Will you be mine forever?
PAP: You drive a hard bargain. Well, how long can that be? All right, I'm
yours! (she suddenly changes into a young woman, dressed like Papageno)
PAP: Papagena?
PAPA: Papageno!
(they are about to embrace, when there is a thunder clap)
1ST PR: Stop! He is not yet worthy!
(she disappears)
PAP: Oh, no! (to priests) You fellows are really getting on my nerves.
Papagena! Papagena! (he runs off)
SCENE V : SARASTRO'S TEMPLE, BEFORE THE DOOR TO THE GREAT HALL
#21 FINALE, ACT II, PART 1 — PAMINA & THE THREE BOYS
THREE BOYS
Quite soon the rosy blush of morning
Will paint the coming day.
And, with the brightly covered dawning.
Drive fear and doubt away.
If only wisdom could so brighten
The minds of men, the dull enlighten,
Then ev’ry person would have worth
And heaven would be here on earth.

1ST BOY
But wait, I hear a woman crying.
2ND & 3RD BOYS
Who is it then?
1ST BOY
Why is she crying?
THREE BOYS
Her heart is torn and almost breaking.
A sad mistake she’s close to making.
She cannot tell the right from wrong,
And death may come to here ere long.
We’ll see what’s preying on her mind
And a solution we will surely find…
A logical solution we will find.
PAM
What must I do? Tamino’s fled.
My mother says that he is dead.
THREE BOYS
A dreadful lie has she been told
By one whose heart is black and cold.
PAM
Oh, blade! How white your steel does shine!
So red you’ll be with good Sarastro’s blood or mine.
THREE BOYS
Ah! To murder she is driven.
Help to her must soon be given.
Now to save her… we appear!
PAM
Don’t come near me!
With no love in my heart for any other,
I’ll be faithful to my mother.
She has told ne I must kill…
THREE BOYS
Maiden! Have you no free will?

PAM
I must follow her instruction
Or I might cause her destruction.
Mother, mother! I’ll do what I must
For in you along I trust.
THREE BOYS
Maiden! Hear now what we say.
PAM
No! My duty’s all too plain.
Still a daughter I remain.
THREE BOYS
A dreadful lie has she been told
By one whose heart is black and cold.
PAM
What? Tamino was not dying?
Then my mother has been lying.
How I long for his embrace.
How could mother be so base?
THREE BOYS
Bitter hatred and despising
Lead to madness ever rising.
For you see, in younger life,
Did Sarastro call her “wife.”
He would save you from her strife.
On his love you may depend.
PAM
Oh, my god! What have I done?
(throws away the daggar)
Thru the night I see the sun
Now to Tamino I would run.
THREE BOYS
All your pain will shortly end.
For man to pass thru storm and weather,
With woman he must join together.
PAM
In love they find the magic charm
To keep them well and safe from harm

THE THREE BOYS
In love they find the magic charm
To keep them well and safe from harm
SCENE IV: THE OPENING TO A CAVE OUTSIDE THE TEMPLE
#21 FINALE, ACT II, PART 2 — PAMINA, TAMINO, TWO ARMORED MEN
TWO ARMORED MEN
One who would test his courage dares to approach this portal.
For he shall risk his life in danger mortal.
If, thru the dread inferno, he can find his way,
And he is steadfast thru the blinding spray,
He shall among the greatest take his place,
For he has shown he has the strength to lead his race.
TAM
I must fear death or I’d be lying
Yet on this charm I am relying.
Therefore, I face your final trial.
My honor I shall not defile.
PAM
Tamino, wait! I’m coming too!
TAM
Who calls me? Is that Pamina?
TWO ARMORED MEN
Yes, yes, it is the girl Pamina.
She’s come before the trial’s begun
To give you courage to be strong.
And surely that can do no wrong.
TAM
She’s come before the trial’s begun
To give me courage to be strong.
And surely that can do no wrong.
Dear friends, is speaking now permitted?
TWO ARMORED MEN
Yes, yes, now speaking is permitted.
His love he now may see once more
Tho’ death may wait behind this door

A woman’s love may see him through.
Her virtue has been proven true.
TAM
My love I now may see once more
Tho’ death may wait behind this door
A woman’s love may see me through.
Her virtue has been proven true.
PAM
Tamino mine. You are alive.
TAM
Pamina mine! True love survives.
Your love will give me power
To thwart this Awful place!
PAM
All dangers in this hour
Together we will face.
No longer all alone
To meet the great unknown
Tho’ sharp the thorn before us grows,
There also shall we find a rose.
And when we stand in danger’s way,
The flute enchanted shall we play.
One day, a mighty oak was broken by lightning…
Then this magic token my father fashioned with his knife.
All thru the storm he risked his life.
You hold the magic made that day,
And it will guide us one our way.
Its golden tones will provide the might
To part the veil of darkest night.
(Tamino plays the flute as he and Pamina enter the portal leading to the Trial by Fire)
TAM AND PAM
Tho’ fire was raging all around us,
No flame our skin did scald or sear.
The torment cannot crush or drown us.
No tribulation do we fear.
The spell of magic fast has bound us,
As journey’s ending now we near.

We’ve found the answer to our quest.
True love will answer any test.
PRIESTS
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! O noble pair!
The greatest bond you now will share.
The temple doors swing open wide.
Come, come, enter by each other’s side.
(All enter the temple as Papageno appears, distraught)
SCENE VII: SARASTRO'S TEMPLE, BEFORE THE DOOR TO THE
GREAT HALL
PAP
Papagena! Papagena! Papagena!
Sweetheart! Darling! Lovey dovey!
It’s hopeless.
Oh, how I do miss her…
I never got a chance to kiss her.
A blabbermouth…blabbermouth… that is my plight!
Now she is lost, it serves me right.
Now she’s lost, it serves me right.
Right from the time I drank the wine,
She has been all I’m dreaming of.
She is so very, very fine!
I am in love. I am in love.
Papagena, little cutey!
Papagena, thing of beauty!
Not a sound, she’s gone forever,
Hopeless is this whole endeavor.
In my heart I’ll have no rest.
Maybe death would be the best.
Hanging’s one quick way of killing,
And there’s not much pain, God willing.
Just a snap and I am done,
Never more to see the sun.

Such a martyr this has made me,
Nothing ever would dissuade me.
Since the world no love will send,
I will make my fatal end… I will make my fatal end!
Time has not run out completely.
If some lady asks me sweetly,
I might put it off a week!
Did I hear somebody speak?
Not a whimper… I am certain!
Now my pride is hurting.
This is very disconcerting!
Papageno, time to die…
You will hear no maiden cry.
No, she must be late!
That’s right! I’d better wait.
You will see… she’ll be here when I count three.
One… two… three.
Now I’ve said my final word.
Time to strangle this poor bird.
Not a person seems to care,
So I’ll end this sad affair.
THREE BOYS
Hold on! Hold on! Hold on!
Hear, Papageno, what we say;
Don’t be so quick to throw your life away.
PAP
You took your time, I don’t mind saying.
But my position’s most dismaying.
I’m feeling very much alone
Without a girl to call my own.
THREE BOYS
You silly fellow, stop your fretting!
The magic bells you’ve been forgetting.
PAP
My God, you’re right, I wasn’t thinking.
Oh, pretty bells, I’ll set you clinking.

Your magic spells I sorely need.
(Papageno plays his magic bells)
Ringing, always ringing… seek my darling’s ear!
Singing, sweetly singing… bring my lover here!
My lover here!
THE THREE BOYS
Now Papageno, turn around!
(The three boys disappear as Papagena appears)
PAPAGENO
Pa, Pa, Pa!
PAPAGENA
Pa, Pa, Pa!
PAPAGENO
Pa, Pa,Pa, Pa!
PAPAGENA
Pa, Pa, Pa, Pa! etc.
PAPAGENO
Pa, Pa, Pa, Pa, Papagena!
PAPAGENA
Pa, Pa, Pa, Papageno!
PAPAGENO
Promise now you’ll stay forever!
PAPAGENA
Yes, I’ll stay now and forever!
PAPAGENO
We’ll be lovebirds of a feather!
PAPAGENA
Nestling oh, so snug together!

PAPAGENO
Oh, how happy we will be.
Soon it will be time for nesting.
PAPAGENA
Oh, how happy we will be.
Soon it will be time for nesting.
BOTH
It will be most interesting,
And then one day we’ll be a flock.
What a shock! What a shock!
Where there were two, there’s now a flock.
PAPAGENO
First, there’s a little Papageno…
PAPAGENA
Then, there’s a little Papagena…
PAPAGENO
First, yet another Papageno…
Papageno! Papageno! Papageno! Papageno!
PAPAGENA
Then, there’s a little Papagena…
Papagena! Papagena! Papagena! Papagena!
PAPAGENO
Where is the tree whose limbs will hold us
With such a lot of Papa, papa, etc. Papagenos
Until they fly away so free?
PAPAGENA
Where is the tree whose limbs will hold us
With such a lot of Papa, papa, etc. Papagenas
Until they fly away so free?
PAPAGENO
Papageno, Papageno, pa,pa,pa,pa,pa,pa, pa,pa, Papageno,
Until they fly away so free, etc.
Papageno!

PAPAGENA
Papagena, Papagena, pa,pa,pa,pa,pa,pa, pa,pa, Papagena,
Until they fly away so free, etc.
Papagena!
#21 FINALE, ACT II, PART 3 — QUEEN OF THE NIGHT, 3 LADIES,
MONOSTATOS, THEN ALL.
Night, some time later. The Queen and Three Ladies follow Monostatos
to the Temple entrance
MON
Along the hallways of the temple,
In ev’ry shadow we must hide.
QUEEN AND LADIES
The hated tyrant now will tremble
When he confronts his homicide.
MON
Your Highness, keep your word…
I helped you. Pamina now must be my bride.
QUEEN
Your price is high, but I will pay it.
My daughter now will be your bride.
My child shall be the traitor’s bride!
LADIES
Yes, yes, her child shall be the traitor’s bride!
MON
I hear a sound like distant thunder,
And yet it seems within these walls.
QUEEN AND LADIES
Yes, I am full of wonder.
What can it be that so appalls?
MON
They are inside beyond the landing…

QUEEN AND LADIES
Then we will kill them where they’re standing!
Yes, we will kill them where they’re standing.
We will unloose, with matchless might,
The dreaded forces of the night
LADIES
Oh, Queen, the war is nearly won!
Your reign of darkness will have begun!
(Thunder. The temple door opens. Sarastro appears in a blazing shaft of sunlight)
QUEEN, LADIES, MONOSTATOS
The hot shaft of sunlight has doomed us to die!
To hell we descend as in terror we cry!
(they descend out of sight)
SARASTRO
The bright glare of sunlight has conquered the night
As truth shatters falsehood and wrong flies from right!
ALL
Rays of truth and virtue
Burn thru evil’s blight.
Hope is now triumphant.
Love is man’s guiding light.
The good are triumphant and justice is done.
Thru knowledge and courage all glory is won!
