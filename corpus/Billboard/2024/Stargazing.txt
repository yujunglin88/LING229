Time stood still
Just like a photograph
You made me feel like this would last forever
Looking in your eyes
I see my whole life
They say you know it when you know it, and I know
(Oh-oh-oh)
Promise that you'll hold me close, don't let me go
(Hey!)
Take my heart, don't break it
Love me to my bones
All this time I wasted
You were right there all along
You and I stargazing
Intertwining souls
We were never strangers
You were right there all along
I lose my mind
When I'm around you, how I come alive
When I'm without you, I can't help but feel so lost
I wanna give you all I've got
They say you know it when you know it, and I know
(Oh-oh-oh)
Promise that you'll hold me close, don't let me go
(Hey!)
Take my heart, don't break it
Love me to my bones
All this time I wasted
You were right there all along
You and I stargazing
Intertwining souls
We were never strangers
You were right there all along
All along
Take my heart, don't break it
Love me to my bones
All this time I wasted
You were right there all along
