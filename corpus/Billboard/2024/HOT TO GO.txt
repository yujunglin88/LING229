Five, six
Five, six, seven, eight
I could be the one, or your new addiction
It's all in my head but I want non-fiction
I don't want the world, but I'll take this city
Who can blame a girl? Call me hot, not pretty
Baby, do you like this beat? (Na-na-na-na, na)
I made it so you'd dance with me (na-na-na-na, na)
It's like a hundred 99 degrees (na-na-na-na, na)
When you're doing it with me, doing it with me
H-O-T-T-O-G-O
Snap and clap and touch your toes
Raise your hands, now body roll
Dance it out, you're hot to go
H-O-T-T-O-G-O
Snap and clap and touch your toes
Raise your hands, now body roll
H-O-T-T-O-G-O
H-O-T-T-O-G-O
You can take me hot to go
H-O-T-T-O-G-O
You can take me hot to go
Well, I woke up alone staring at my ceiling
I try not to care but it hurts my feelings
You don't have to stare, come here, get with it
No one's touched me there in a damn hot minute
And baby, don't you like this beat? (Na-na, na-na-na)
I made it so you'd sleep with me (na-na, na-na-na)
It's like a hundred 99 degrees (na-na, na-na-na)
When you're doing it with me, doing it with me
H-O-T-T-O-G-O
Snap and clap and touch your toes
Raise your hands, now body roll
Dance it out, you're hot to go
H-O-T-T-O-G-O
Snap and clap and touch your toes
Raise your hands, now body roll
H-O-T-T-O-G-O
H-O-T-T-O-G-O
You can take me hot to go
H-O-T-T-O-G-O
You can take me hot to go
What's it take to get your number? What's it take to bring you home?
Hurry up, it's time for supper, order up, I'm hot to go
What's it take to get your number? Hurry up, it's getting cold
Hurry up, it's time for supper, order up, I'm hot to go
H-O-T-T-O-G-O
You can take me hot to go (oh, yeah)
H-O-T-T-O-G-O
You can take me hot to go (hot to go)
H-O-T-T-O-G-O
You can take me hot to go (oh, yeah)
H-O-T-T-O-G-O
You can take me hot to go
Whew, it's hot here, is anyone else hot?
Whoo, you coming home with me?
Okay, it's hot, I'll call the cab
