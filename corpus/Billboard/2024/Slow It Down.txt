I'd never met you, but I wanted to invite you to the party
Then you walked in with those green eyes, never stolen by nobody
And they flicker to the future, for a moment, I could picture
Then you touch me and I come back, and we're talking on the staircase
'Bout your big dreams on the big screens
Out of Georgia, now you're lonely in this city
Lyin' with me, and you're scared it's movin' quickly
Oh, now you're crying, you're in pieces
'Cause the only love you've ever known is Jesus
I can feel it
Oh, I hate that I'm the reason
That you're in your head right now
While your world is spinning out
So slow it down, take a moment now
We're too young to drown deep in dirty waters
Full of hopeless doubt, let me pull you out
Let me hold you now, let me slow it down
Ain't it funny how it changes?
How the future rearranges
I get nervous, oh, I'm anxious
Maybe loving you is dangerous
I could lose you like the others
Only girl that's never left me is my mother
Oh, I love her
And I know you'll probably hate it
But I'm in my head right now
So slow it down, take a moment now
We're too young to drown deep in dirty waters
Full of hopeless doubt, let me pull you out
Let me hold you now, let me (slow it down)
Slow it down when you're on the ground
And you're crying, I'm trying (slow it down)
To slow it down when you're spinning 'round
In your head
Ooh, ooh
I'll help you slow it down
