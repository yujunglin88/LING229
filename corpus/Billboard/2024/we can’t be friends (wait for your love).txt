I didn't think you'd understand me
How could you ever even try?
I don't wanna tiptoe, but I don't wanna hide
But I don't wanna feed this monstrous fire
Just wanna let this story die
And I'll be alright
We can't be friends
But I'd like to just pretend
You cling to your papers and pens
Wait until you like me again
Wait for your love
Love, I'll wait for your love
Me and my truth, we sit in silence
Mm, baby girl, it's just me and you
'Cause I don't wanna argue, but I don't wanna bite
My tongue, yeah, I think I'd rather die
You got me misunderstood
But at least I look this good
We can't be friends
But I'd like to just pretend
You cling to your papers and pens
Wait until you like me again
Wait for your love
Love, I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love
Love, I'll wait for your love
Know that you made me
I don't like how you paint me
Yet, I'm still here hanging
Not what you made me
It's something like a daydream
But I feel so seen in the night
So for now, it's only me
And maybe that's all I need
We can't be friends
But I'd like to just pretend
You cling to your papers and pens
Wait until you like me again
Wait for your love
Love, I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love
Love, I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love
I'll wait for your love
