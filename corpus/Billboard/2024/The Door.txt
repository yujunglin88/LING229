I took a page out of your favorite book
You sold me lies just by the way you look
Taught me a language that I never speak
Baby, that ain't for me
That, that ain't for me
I dug my grave watching the way you move
You took me higher than I ever flew
Too many times, gave you a second chance
Baby, I'm just a man
I'm, I'm just a man
No more thinking about you late night
No more running around with your friends now
Done picking up pieces of my soul up off the floor
I said I would die for you, baby
But I can't take this pain no more
I thought I was willing
But tonight I save my life when I showed you the door
I don't want to lose you, baby
But I can't play this game no more
I thought it would kill me
But tonight I saved my life when I showed you the door
You never thought this day would ever come
But I looked you in the eyes and pulled the rug
You tried to take away my sanity
Baby, that ain't for me
That, that ain't for me
Oh, no more thinking about you late night
No more running around with your friends now
Done picking up pieces of my soul from up the floor
I said I would die for you, baby
But I can't take this pain no more
I thought I was willing
But tonight I saved my life when I showed you the door
I don't want to lose you, baby
But I can't play this game no more
I thought it would kill me
But tonight I saved my life when I showed you the door
When I showed you the door
When I showed you the door
But tonight I saved my life
I said I would die for you, baby
But I can't take this pain no more
I thought I was willing
But tonight I saved my life when I showed you the door
I don't want to lose you, baby (I don't want to lose you, baby)
But I can't take this game no more
I thought it'd kill me (I thought it'd kill me)
But tonight I saved my life when I showed you the door
Hmm-mm
Whoa-oh
