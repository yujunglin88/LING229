Last Christmas I gave you my heart,
But the very next day you gave it away.
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special.
Last Christmas I gave you my heart,
But the very next day you gave it away.
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special.
Once bitten and twice shy.
I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye.
Tell me baby, do you recognise me?
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me.
"Happy Christmas" I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying "I love you", I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again.
Last Christmas I gave you my heart,
But the very next day you gave it away.
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special.
Last Christmas I gave you my heart,
But the very next day you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone specia.
Oo - ooh
Crowded room, friends with tired eyes.
Hiding from you and your soul of ice
My Gosh, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me? I guess I was a shoulder to cry on.
Face on another with a fire in his heart.
A man under cover but you tore me apart.
Ooh, ooh, now I've found a real love,
You'll never fool me again.
Last Christmas I gave you my heart,
But the very next day you gave it away.
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special.
Last Christmas I gave you my heart,
But the very next day you gave it away.
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special.
Last Christmas I gave you my heart,
But the very next day you gave it away.
This year, to save me from tears,
I'll give it to someone special.
