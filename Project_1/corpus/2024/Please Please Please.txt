I know I have good judgement, I know I have good taste
It's funny and it's ironic that only I feel that way
I promise 'em that you're different and everyone makes mistakes
But just don't
I heard that you're an actor, so act like a stand-up guy
Whatever devil's inside you, don't let him out tonight
I tell them it's just your culture and everyone rolls their eyes
Yeah, I know
All I'm asking, baby
Please, please, please don't prove I'm right
Please, please, please
Don't bring me to tears when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing, my ego's another
I beg you, don't embarrass me, motherfucker, oh
Please, please, please (ah)
Well, I have a fun idea, babe (uh-huh), maybe just stay inside
I know you're craving some fresh air
But the ceiling fan is so nice (it's so nice, right?)
And we could live so happily if no one knows that you're with me
I'm just kidding, but really (kinda), really, really
Please, please, please don't prove I'm right
Please, please, please
Don't bring me to tears when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing (heartbreak is one thing), my ego's another (ego's another)
I beg you, don't embarrass me, motherfucker, ah
Please, please, please (ah)
If you wanna go and be stupid, don't do it in front of me
If you don't wanna cry to my music, don't make me hate you prolifically
Please, please, please (please)
Please, please, please (please)
Please (please), please (please), please (ah)
